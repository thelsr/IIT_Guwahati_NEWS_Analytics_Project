Chinese experts said it reflects Tokyo's political opportunism amid recent positive signals in China-Japan relations. They urged Japan to listen to domestic rational voices on China rather than follow the US in containing China and ending up in a worse situation.According to a Reuters report on Thursday, Japan will closely monitor the increasing cooperation between China and Russia with a sense of concern and decisively protect its territories, said Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno at a news conference after Chinese and Russian militaries conducted  in the Asia-Pacific region on Wednesday.Japan deliberately connecting itself to peaceful China-Russia joint patrols, which do not target other countries or a third party, is intended to create an excuse to treat China as a threat, Lü Chao, an expert on Korean Peninsula issues at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Thursday.Experts urged Japan to cherish the hard-won ties with China, which have seen warming signals recently. Despite recent positive signals in China-Japan relations, including a summit between the two leaders earlier this month, a  to begin operations, as well as a possible China visit by the , Japan has continued to provoke China and play up the so-called ""China threat"" theory both at home and abroad. According to an NHK news report on Thursday, Japanese officials plan to refer to China first and North Korea second as regional security challenges in its upcoming National Security Strategy, which outlines Japan's basic diplomatic and defense policies and is expected to be revised by the end of this year. A reference to Russia will also likely be added, NHK reported.The plan came after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday ordered  of its GDP in fiscal 2027.Lü said Japan's contradictory acts resulted from a situation in which its domestic anti-China forces are getting stronger under the political, economic and military impact of the US, despite some rational voices calling for peace and friendly engagement with China. Such a dangerous trend is harmful to Japan itself, the expert pointed out.If Japan is bent on going its own way by increasing its military funding, provoking China on hot-button issues and hyping the ""China threat"" theory, the China-Japan relationship maintained through the efforts of generations of the two countries' leaders are likely to be damaged, the expert warned.

I was very sad."" Wang Yuge, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) branch of a working team of Tianjin Port Container Terminal Co., Ltd., said he was deeply grieved at the news of Jiang's death.Wang recalled that he was only an ordinary truck driver on the dock when Jiang visited the Tianjin Port during an inspection tour. The port has undergone sea changes over the past 30 years, becoming a maritime gateway of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and maintaining trade with over 500 ports in more than 180 countries and regions.Yan'an, an old revolutionary base in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, was gripped by great sorrow.""Comrade Jiang Zemin's visit to Yan'an is still in the minds of the Yan'an people,"" said Feng Mei, director of a research institute dedicated to promoting the Yan'an Spirit.Feng recounted that after Jiang formulated the Theory of Three Represents, the whole city implemented and practiced the theory, bringing about notable improvements to the Party's conduct and the relationship between the Party and the masses in the city.Liu Jiming, an 80-year-old former village Party chief in Datong City in north China's Shanxi Province, said Jiang's inspection tour in Datong following an earthquake in the city in January 1990 was still fresh in his memory.""He came down to the village, asked about our needs and encouraged us to rebuild our homes,"" Liu said.Ma Yonghuan, Party chief of Guangming Village in southwest China's Guizhou Province, recalled the changes Jiang brought to the village.""There was a time when the village had no access to water and electricity and we had to walk kilometers of mountain roads to collect water. After Comrade Jiang Zemin visited our village, the village became electrified and the roads were paved, and the industry thrived,"" Ma said. ""We wish he could come and see it again.""Li Xi, a former curator of a museum in Lijiang, still remembered Jiang's inspection trip to the Old Town of Lijiang in southwest China's Yunnan Province in 1999.""Jiang listened to the ancient music of the Naxi people, chatted with merchants and tourists, and sang and danced with people of ethnic minorities.

Politics,By Xu Keyue  |  2022/11/30 12:16:43,Japan warned of being 'biggest destabilizing factor' in E.Asia as Kishida sets defense spending at 2% of GDP for 1st time,"Considering Japan, a country with the pacifist constitution and claims to adhere on the path of peace, is eyeing to further arm itself, there is a big question mark hanging over the country's future whether it would repeat its historic mistakes, Chinese observers expressed deep concerns after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday ordered the defense budget to rise to two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 2027.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-14/2f1a0fbc-5d76-448d-a6fe-9ba56311556e.jpeg," Considering Japan, a country with the pacifist constitution and claims to adhere on the path of peace, is eyeing to further arm itself, there is a big question mark hanging over the country's future whether it would repeat its historic mistakes, Chinese observers expressed deep concerns after Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday ordered the defense budget to rise to two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in fiscal 2027.According to the Japan Times on Tuesday, Kishida has instructed his defense and finance chiefs to boost defense spending to two percent of GDP by 2027 - a target long sought by the ruling party but now referred to by Kishida as a specific budget figure for the first time.""Instead of saying we can't do so due to the lack of financial resources, we need to come up with ways to secure the necessary funds swiftly,"" Japanese Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada said at the meeting.Japan has long capped its annual defense spending at about 1 percent of GDP, or 5 trillion yen ($36 billion). The Defense Ministry said that 48 trillion yen will be required for the next five years to improve the country's defense capabilities, Kyodo News reported, citing the concern over ""China's growing military strength and North Korea's missile development.""Japan's decision of boosting its defense budget to 2 percent of its GDP over five years - a level on par with the military alliance NATO member states - comes as a growing hype over the ""external security threats"" in the narratives of the Japanese government, politicians and media in recent years especially since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Da Zhigang, director of the Institute of Northeast Asian Studies at Heilongjiang Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday.While describing the Ukraine crisis as a trigger which may have accelerated the decision to come, Da believes to raise the defense budget essentially targets China.Recently, not only has the dispute between the two countries over the Diaoyu Islands intensified, but also tensions over the Taiwan question have been hyped by Japanese conservative forces, observers said. The hot-button issues have been used by the Japanese conservative forces to incite Japanese public concern over their external environment, which in turn made the whole society turning more right, observers said.Lü Yaodong, a research fellow with the Institute of Japanese Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,  said previously the Japanese government was playing up the Russia-Ukraine conflict, changes in surrounding areas and in the international situation, and claiming to protect the ""national security,"" which have laid the groundwork for increasing the defense budget. Now it seems that the budget increasing issue began to enter the implementation stage.If the defense budget is increased to 2% of the GDP, other spending will have to be reduced. In addition, whether or not to raise taxes and what kind of taxes to raise are topics that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party needs to discuss, Lü noted.According to the Chinese version of Nikkei Shimbun on Tuesday, some politicians have put forward at the meeting on increasing defense spending that Japanese citizens should pay for the rising budget through a wide range of taxes. Some officials in the Japanese government argued that the government should raise funds by raising taxes such as corporate tax, income tax and tobacco tax, the report noted.Although there could be many Japanese people opposing the decision since the decision is very likely to raise their taxes and increase their burden amid the country's highest inflation in decades, the opposition voices are more likely to be far from overturning the decision, said Da, noting this has exposed one of the biggest problems in the more conservative Japanese society.On Saturday, Kyodo News cited a source familiar with the matter as saying that ""Japan is considering using an enemy base strike capability, or what it prefers to call 'counterstrike capability,' with its ally the United States, in the event it comes under attack.""Both Kishida's order to an increase of the defense budget and the plan to use enemy base strike capability have come ahead of update of the National Security Strategy, Japan's long-term diplomacy and security policy guideline, and compile of the initial budget for fiscal 2023, which starts in April, by year-end, local media reported.As Japanese media revealed recently that Kishida is considering making his first visit to the White House since he took office last year ahead of an ordinary session of the Diet, Japan's parliament, in January for talks with US President Joe Biden, Da said the Kishida's order to raise the defense budget and the plan to use enemy base strike capability with the US will serve as ""a gift"" to Biden during their first meeting in the White House.As a country that waged wars of aggression during the World War II, restricted by its pacifist constitution, Japan begins to increase its defense capabilities, which will make the country to become the biggest destabilizing factor in the security environment in East Asia, Lü said. ""There is a big question mark hanging over the country which has claimed to be on the path of peace but tries to further arm itself again,"" Lü said.

Sherman and Sannino reiterated their ""serious concerns"" about the human rights situation in China, including Xinjiang, Xizang, Inner Mongolia and Hong Kong, calling urgent attention by the international community at large.They also discussed China's activities and initiatives in multilateral fora, noting that US and EU objectives will continue to focus on protecting the centrality of the UN Charter.Mao said that the US and Europe emphasize the centrality of the UN Charter, but it is the US and a number of European countries that have ignored the principles clearly stipulated in the charter to peacefully resolve international disputes and non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and interfered in China's internal affairs under the pretext of human rights, and even act violently against Iraq, Syria and other sovereign states.The US openly threatens other countries not to use equipment produced by Chinese firms or cooperate with China, and this has constituted real economic coercion, Mao said, adding that the US also introduced the CHIPS and Science Act, rallying its allies to decouple with the Chinese economy, and used the Inflation Reduction Act to force European companies to transfer their production lines to the US.As a responsible member of the international community, China has always been a contributor to world peace, global development and a defender of the international order. This is widely recognized by the international community, Mao said.The US and the EU should not target any third party in their cooperation, not make an issue of China or provoke confrontation. Both the US and the EU are important forces in the world and should do more to contribute to world stability and prosperity in a responsible manner, she remarked.Global Times                         "

Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting. It was noted at the meeting that this year is extremely important in the history of the Party and the country. Facing the turbulent international environment and arduous tasks of strengthening domestic reform, development and stability, the CPC Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has united and led the whole Party and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups in rising to challenges. As a result, macro-control has been intensified, the quality of development improved, achievements have been made in scientific and technological innovation, reform and opening-up has been deepened, employment and prices have been kept basically stable, and food and energy security as well as people's livelihood have been ensured. The overall economic and social stability has been maintained. This year, the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics were successfully held. The 20th CPC National Congress was also successfully convened, and solid steps have been taken on the new journey to build a modern socialist country in all respects. It was stressed at the meeting that 2023 will be the first year for the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress to be implemented in a comprehensive manner. To do a good job in our economic work next year, we must follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, fully implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress, solidly advance Chinese modernization, adhere to the general principle of seeking progress in a stable manner, implement the new vision for development in a complete, accurate and comprehensive manner, and accelerate efforts to foster a new development pattern and pursue high-quality development. Efforts are also required to better coordinate epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development, and development with security. To make a good start in building a modern socialist country in all respects, efforts are also needed to deepen reform and opening-up across the board, boost market confidence, integrate the implementation of strategy to expand domestic demand with the efforts to deepen supply-side structural reform, give priority to the work of ensuring steady growth, employment, and stable prices, effectively forestall and defuse major risks, promote the overall improvement in economic operation to achieve both qualitative and quantitative growth. It was noted at the meeting that special attention will be paid to steady growth in the coming year, pursuing progress while ensuring stability. Proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy will continue to be implemented, efforts will be made to coordinate different policies and optimize epidemic responses, so as to form synergy for high-quality development. The proactive fiscal policy should be intensified for its effectiveness, and the prudent monetary policy should be targeted and effective. Industrial policies should boost development and security, and policies concerning science and technology will focus on self-reliance and self-improvement. Social policies must ensure people's livelihood. Further efforts will be made to expand domestic demand and give full play to the fundamental role of consumption and the key role of investment. Work was emphasized at the meeting to speed up modernizing the industrial system and strengthen the resilience of industrial and supply chains and their security as well. The basic policies will be strengthened to unswervingly consolidate and develop the public sector while encouraging, supporting and guiding the development of the non-public sector so that the socialist modernization endeavors will be injected with fresh dynamism and vitality. Work will be done to boost opening up at a higher level and to further attract and make good use of foreign investment. Effective approaches will be adopted to defuse major economic and financial hazards and guard against systemic risks. It was stressed at the meeting that the Party's overall leadership over economic work must be strengthened, and the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress must be studied, understood and implemented comprehensively. The mechanism of implementing the major decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee must be optimized. Down-to-earth efforts must be made to unleash the whole society's vitality for initiative, so as to ensure that officials and enterprises dare to make decisions on their own while local authorities and residents dare to blaze new trails. Efforts must be coordinated to ensure stable supply and price of important commodities for people's lives, and guarantee the delivery and supply of coal, electricity, oil and natural gas. Enough concern must be shown to the livelihood and work of people in difficulty, make sure that migrant workers are paid on time, and workplace safety and disaster control and prevention work must be strengthened to safeguard social harmony and stability. It was pointed out at the meeting that great efforts have been made in the past 10 years in exercising full and strict governance of the Party, and the fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory and the success has been fully consolidated, but there is still a long way to go. We must always stay alert and determined to tackle the challenges unique to a big political party, remain resolute and persistent in the never-ending fight against corruption, and further strengthen our political resolve to exercise full and strict governance of the Party. We must maintain the keynote of strictness, the rigorous measures, and the strict atmosphere for a long time to come, carrying out the Party's great self-reform in the new era. Discipline inspection and supervision organs must always adhere to the Party's founding mission, faithfully fulfill the duties entrusted to them by the Party Constitution and the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, and resolutely implement the Party's strategic plan for self-reform and the strategic principle of exercising full and strict governance of the Party. They must work ceaselessly to improve Party conduct, enforce Party discipline and fight corruption, push for the improvement of the Party and state oversight systems, build an iron team of disciplinary inspection and supervision, and promote high-quality development of discipline inspection and supervision work, thus providing a strong guarantee for the realization of the Party's mission and tasks in the new era and on the new journey. It was stressed at the meeting that the spirit of the Party's 20th National Congress must be firmly adhered to and fully implemented, and the authority and centralized, unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee must be upheld through strong political oversight, so as to promptly identify and punish those performing ill deeds of cronyism, forming cliques and factions, making anonymous false accusations, buying support, making lavish promises, agreeing overtly but opposing covertly and acting wantonly and issuing groundless criticism of the CPC Central Committee decisions and policies. The central Party leadership's eight-point decision must be constantly strengthened to improve conduct, crack down on all forms of decadence for hedonism and extravagance in a timely manner, and strictly investigate and punish disciplinary violations. Approaches must be adopted to resolutely prevent the rebound and the hidden mutation of unhealthy conduct and violations, and the fight should never be slackened because of fatigue. Efforts should be focused on rectifying meaningless formalities and bureaucracy and close attention be paid to excessive implementation of policies, slackness and negligence in the work, willful use of power, lack of responsibility and inaction. Targeted measures must be adopted to address these problems. Prominence must be given to the role of discipline. Requirements for strictness must be implemented throughout the whole process of formulating Party regulations, Party discipline education, and Party discipline enforcement and supervision, so that the disciplines and regulations bite so as to let officials know where to toe the line. We will fight a tough and protracted battle against corruption with the spirit of complete self-reform. We will take it as the most important work to thoroughly investigate, severely punish those reckless corrupt officials who did not mend their ways and behave since the 18th CPC National Congress. Focus will be placed on corruption that involves both political and economic elements, corruption in sectors with high concentration of power, funds and resources, and corrupt low-ranking officials, whose misconduct directly affects people's lives. We will further eradicate breeding grounds for corruption. Work must be done to improve the Party and state supervisory system, give full play to the role of political inspection, and strengthen the effective oversight of ""top leaders"" and leading groups. Prior to this meeting, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, during which a briefing was given on the work of the CCDI and the National Commission of Supervision and the preparations for the second plenary session of the 20th CCDI.

It is the first time since World War II that Japan has sent fighter jets to an ASEAN member state for ""friendly exchanges,"" the report said.The Philippines was occupied by Japan during World War II and an estimated 1.1 million civilians were killed, according to Japan's Kyodo News agency. Japanese fighter planes took off from Mabalacat's airfield during World War II, and anti-Japanese sentiment ran high among local people.The fighters' arrival marked a milestone in the history of defense exchanges between Japan and the Philippines, the Japan Times quoted Shotaro Arisawa, an ASDF squadron commanding officer, as saying.Lt. Gen. Connor Anthony Canlas, a Philippine Air Force commander, said last month the Japanese ""are now our allies who believe in the rule of law.""Japan and the Philippines have been deepening defense collaboration. The two sides held their first ""two plus two"" talks between diplomatic and defense chiefs in April. Japan is exporting four units of an air defense radar system that detects incoming fighter jets and missiles. Japan has also transferred two patrol vessels to the Philippines, said a report by Nikkei Asia on Wednesday.This is the first time that the Japanese government has exported defense equipment since it changed its arms embargo in 2014.Japan's flight of F-15 fighter jets to the Philippines is apparently aimed at strengthening military cooperation between the two countries, so that Japan can expand its military presence in the South China Sea. But Japan is gradually handing over its retired F-15 fighter jets to the Philippines, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Japan is now eager to go overseas, with the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force trying to find overseas transit stations and footholds so as to support its military presence in distant regions. The Air Self-Defense Force, maritime Self-Defense Force and ground Self-Defense Force will try every means to boost their presence in the future, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times.He said that judging from the current situation, the Philippines has not allowed the Japanese Self-Defense Forces to stay permanently. The infrastructure of the Clark Air Force Base is aging, and it does not have the ability to provide logistical support for a large number of advanced fighter jets.""If the defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines involves infrastructure, such as technological transformation and improvement of air bases and airfields, then the deployment of Japanese military forces can be seen more clearly. But in any case, Japan's efforts will add more insecurity and instability in the South China Sea,"" Wei noted.Wei explained that the US plays a big role in the defense cooperation between Japan and the Philippines, and hopes to bring together its allies in the Asia-Pacific region, including Japan and Australia, for joint military operations. The US also hopes that Japan can find a foothold around the South China Sea to rest and resupply, so as to better assist the US military to carry out various military operations.The phrase ""for the first time since World War II"" has begun to appear again. On September 28, three German warplanes arrived in Japan for a three-day joint training exercise with the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force, which is the first time since World War II that the two sides have held drills in Japanese airspace.In this regard, Song said that Japan may take more and more similar actions in the future, because Japan has always believed that it is subject to the pacifist Constitution and is an ""abnormal country"". If it wants to become a ""normal country,"" it means that it has to break the restrictions imposed by the constitution in various ways.However, Song believes that the key reason why Japan is not a ""normal country"" lies in its failure to have a correct understanding of historical issues, and that is the core problem.

In a deliberate move to hype China's military strength, the report discussed China's nuclear arsenal and played up China's possible military actions to the island of Taiwan and the ""Indo-Pacific region.""Chinese military experts believe the reports is aimed at hyping the China threat theory and demonize China's rightful military development, and serve the US' goal of pulling regional countries to its side to contain China. However, they point out that the US, the biggest owner of nuclear warheads which is constantly stirring up conflicts in other regions, is the biggest threat to global peace.Different from the US, China's military development only serves to defend its core interests, such as preparing for any possible scenario that may happen in the Taiwan Straits. The annual report, compiled by the Pentagon for the US Congress, said that Beijing ""probably accelerated"" its nuclear expansion last year and was on track to have a stockpile of 1,500 nuclear weapons by 2035.The report looks at China's military modernization and defense strategy, but also looks at elements of China's economic policy and foreign policy, ""and how these all kind of fit together with the military and defense modernization in pursuit of its regional and global ambitions,"" a Pentagon official said. In response to US hype, Zhao Lijian, spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that the  in recent years, the US has been hyping up various versions of the ""China threat"" narrative simply to find pretext for expanding its nuclear arsenal and perpetuating military predominance. The world knows well that this is a go-to tactic of the US.He said China's nuclear policy is consistent and clear. We follow a self-defensive nuclear strategy. We stick to the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons. We have exercised utmost restraint in developing nuclear capabilities. We have kept those capabilities at the minimum level required by national security. We are never part of any form of arms race.The US has the largest nuclear arsenal in the world. It has in recent years kept upgrading its ""nuclear triad,"" and strengthening the role of nuclear weapons in its national security policies. To this day, the US still clings to a nuclear deterrence policy based on first use of nuclear weapons, and openly devises nuclear deterrence strategies against particular countries. The US is engaged in nuclear submarine cooperation with the UK and Australia, which violates the object and purposes of the NPT. Our suggestion is to go through the recent reports issued by the US itself to read for yourselves what it has done and will do next on the nuclear front, according to Zhao.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that this year's report used a tougher tone to hype China's ""military threat,"" amid a more complicated international background such as the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the US' constant provocation on the Taiwan question.""It aims to tell countries, especially those in the Indo-Pacific region that China poses a bigger threat than ever, and to pull those countries together to contain China,"" Song said.Yet he pointed out that the US is the real saboteur in the region. Moreover, the US Department of Defense recently released its 2022 Nuclear Posture Review. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said that as the US nuclear capability remains the ""ultimate backstop"" for strategic deterrence, the department plans to continue modernization efforts on the nuclear triad.The US is the biggest nuclear threat in the world, as it owns 5,428 nuclear warheads as of January 2022, media reported.China's nuclear weapons are way behind the US in terms of quality and quantity, said experts. Huang Zhicheng, an aerospace expert, told the Global Times that China is the only country in the world that insists on not using nuclear weapons first, which the US has never said it would do, yet the report neglects this point. Even if China attains a nuclear arsenal of 1,500 warheads as the US alleges, it only accounts for one-third of the US' stockpile. ""The US has adopted constant nuclear intimidation since the Cold War, which makes many countries without nuclear weapons feel insecure. When the US is strengthening nuclear weapons' role in its national security strategy, it lowers the threshold of using nuclear weapons, which constitutes a future nuclear threat,"" Huang said. Song also defended China's development of nuclear weapons, saying that although China commits to no first use of nuclear weapons, it is necessary to have those weapons in hand to defend the country's interests. ""Let me be frank. China's policy on nuclear power is consistent. We use it for self-defense, we will not be the first to use nuclear power, and we develop nuclear capabilities with an ultimate goal of eliminating nuclear weapons. We develop nuclear capabilities to protect the peaceful hard work of the Chinese people and to protect our country from the scourge of war, particularly nuclear war,"" State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe said in June.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that the Pentagon is hyping China's rapid military technological development so it can get more funding, and it is attempting to ally the West to strategically compete with China, Li said.The US will never accept China to surpass it as the leading global military power, so it will increase investment to ensure the US is leading by a large margin, or it will deliberately create conflict or even crises with China to disrupt China's steady military development, Li said. ""We should be alert to that and prepared for it,"" Li said.  The US report devoted large parts to playing up the Chinese military actions around the island of Taiwan. The Pentagon said that even before Pelosi's visit, China had in 2021 conducted increasingly frequent and realistic ""island-seizure"" exercises. Song said China's actions are preparing for any scenario to solve the Taiwan question. ""We will strive our best to solve it by peaceful means, but if any outside force tries to stir up trouble and Taiwan secessionists try to take any risk, then the Chinese army will solve this question by any means possible. By then, those trouble fanners and secessionists will be sinners of history,"" Song said.Resolving the Taiwan question has always been an important objective in the PLA's development, and as was demonstrated in the ""island encirclement"" drills in August, the PLA is fully capable of locking down the island from external military interference, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times When meeting with US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin last week, Wei emphasized that the Taiwan question is the core of China's interests and the first insurmountable red line in China-US relations.Wei said that Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and the settlement of the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own affair and brooks no foreign interference.

The tourist attraction released a notice on Monday that the local police have started investigating the case and called on people to behave responsibly.Yue Fei, a military commander during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), is a household name in China, who was famous for his loyalty and courage. The legend of Yue’s story was widespread that his mother tattooed four Chinese characters on his back -- “jing zhong bao guo,” meaning serving the country with total loyalty.At around 2:10 pm on Sunday, a visitor suddenly became emotional and shouted “Let’s restore our lost land” standing on a censer in front of Yue Fei temple, and forcibly lifted the iron plate covering the censer and smashed the statues, according to the Taihao mausoleum. The guy left the scene finally under the working staff’s persuasion. The working staff immediately called the police who are now investigating the case, said the tourist attraction.The statues have not been damaged, fortunately, the kneeling statues are modern imitations and do not belong to historical relics, according to the Taihao mausoleum.Taihao mausoleum received 300,000 visits in seven-day Chinese Spring Festival, a record high in three years, said the tourist attraction. The movie Man Jiang Hong, directed by Chinese well-known director Zhang Yimou, a revenge story between Yue Fei and Qin Hui, a treacherous official who murdered Yue, was released during the holidays, attracting a large number of people.Some netizens don’t agree with this kind of “extreme” move and noted that visitors should behave civilizedly and reasonably.The local tourist authorities immediately installed guardrails and increased security personnel to guide tourists visit in a civilized manner. The tourist attraction called the visitors to be civilized when visiting public places and respect local customs, cultural traditions and religious beliefs.                          "

However, it shows no significant increase in its ability to cause disease, posing only a minimal threat to China, an expert was quoted as saying by Jiankang Shibao (Health Times) on Tuesday.Statistics from outbreak.info, a community repository of COVID information which traces the COVID-19 epidemic showed that CH.1.1, also known as ""Orthrus"" a descendent of BA.2.75, has been detected in over 60 countries including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Cambodia and Ireland. In the US, 51 states have detected the new variant. It emerged in Southeast Asia last fall and is now responsible for more than a quarter of infections in parts of the UK and New Zealand, according to a preprint paper released by researchers at Ohio State University. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been tracing the variant and estimated that it comprises 1.5 percent of US cases. Based on current statistics, the CH.1.1 variant has a certain degree of immune evasion ability and may cause new infections, but there seems no significant increase in its ability to cause disease among the population, Zhao Wei, director of the biosafety research center of the School of Public Health, Southern Medical University, told the Health Times. According to a report from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) on the COVID-19 epidemic nationwide, the current prevailing strains in China are still BA.5.2 and BF.7 with no new mutant strains have been found, Zhao said. According to Zhao, on the one hand, it shows that the border quarantine works so effectively that can prevent large-scale new mutant strains entering China from overseas. On the other hand, the large-scale epidemic in China has just been brought under control, and the immune barrier of the population remains at a relatively high level. It can be judged that recent Omicron variants are less threatening to China. In the recent study posted to bioRxiv preprint server, the researchers at Ohio State University found the CH.1.1 carries the L452R substitution previously discovered in the Delta variant. According to the researchers from Ohio State University, CH.1.1 also binds well to ACE2 receptors, the site where COVID infects human cells, which means it has the potential to override—at least partially—antibody immunity from prior infection and vaccination, as well as to cause more severe disease. It may be able to outperform other competitive Omicron strains in these arenas due to a concerning L452R mutation seen in Delta, but generally not in Omicron, the researchers said. Global Times                         "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-08/780770af-e8db-436d-bd82-0ed6ab4d742c.jpeg," The first batch of about 30 cross-border pupils returned to Hong Kong on Wednesday for face-to-face classes, as this group of students has not been able to attend classes in Hong Kong due to pandemic restrictions since 2020. Local officials, lawmakers and parents of cross-border students applauded the move, which is seen as a significant sign for people exchanges between the city and the Chinese mainland to return normalcy. Some parents and representatives from the education sector of Hong Kong also told the Global Times that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government and schools have been fully prepared for the return of cross-border students, and all students are expected to return to in-person classes before the end of February at the latest.Currently, a major focus is on whether authorities can scrap the daily nucleic acid testing for those students and allow them to use rapid antigen tests to facilitate daily transit between Hong Kong and the mainland.Fung Kai No. 1 Primary School in Sheung Shui welcomed about 30 cross-border students on Wednesday morning after a three-year suspension of in-person classes, according to local media reports. With a daily quota for cross-border travelers and no separate arrangements in place for cross-border student yet, these pupils are required to reserve a slot and undergo PCR tests before each trip, RTHK said. A primary student surnamed Chow was quoted as saying in the media report that he is very happy to be back after a three-year absence and he was able to see his classmates and teachers online during the pandemic. According to the first phase of border resumption plans unveiled by the HKSAR government, the government will release the arrangement for cross-border pupils in February and they won't need to apply for daily quotas. It's expected that cross-border secondary school students will be allowed to attend in-person classes in Hong Kong from the second week of February, while primary school and kindergarten students can return by the end of February, the Education Bureau said on Friday. Yuxue, whose daughter is among the cross-border students, told the Global Times that she has received a notice from school that her daughter can return to school on February 6. ""We appreciate so much that the country made arrangements for resuming people exchanges between Shenzhen and Hong Kong,"" she said. The three-year period of online classes had a certain impact on the students' grades, especially for secondary school students, who are in a period of teenage rebellion, and who do not want to be disciplined.""When she took online classes, she always closed the door so we couldn't supervise her,"" Yuxue said. ""Teachers could not discipline her through online classes, so the impact on her grades is inevitable."" Some parents like Yuxue hoped that the HKSAR government will pay more attention to this group of students, for example, by opening a special lane for these students. Given that there are nearly 30,000 cross-border students, daily cross-border travel and mandatory nucleic acid tests will create other burdens for them. Lawrence Tang Fei, a lawmaker who is also the vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Federation of Education Workers, told the Global Times that schools are all ready in Hong Kong and all the cross-border students will be able to return to Hong Kong for face-to-face classes by the end of February at the latest. ""But now, a major uncertainty is whether the HKSAR government will arrange PCR test-free travel for those students, or replace it with antigen tests,"" he said.  It's difficult for pupils to go to school, finish their homework and take nucleic acid tests before returning to Shenzhen after the test results come out, and if this issue can't be solved, it will be difficult for cross-border students to truly return to Hong Kong, Tang said. For now, those who enter Hong Kong or enter the mainland through Hong Kong need to hold 48-hour nucleic acid tests, which means cross-border pupils need to take a daily test to meet the entry requirement, or within no less than two days. However, some students may not return to Hong Kong. Kinwai told the Global Times that from 2020 to 2022, his son, a primary student, sometimes took online classes and sometimes went to school. The pandemic forced Kinwai and his wife to live in two cities. ""In September, 2022, when another wave hit Hong Kong, I decided to let the kid study in Shenzhen, as being healthy is more important,"" he said. Kinwai said he is hesitant now following the border resumption, and he decided to wait and see whether to send his son back to Hong Kong or to an international school in the mainland. ""The child has gradually adapted to the school in Shenzhen and the level of education here is not weaker than in Hong Kong. Also, Hong Kong faces a serious loss of primary school teachers, which affects the quality of study,"" he said. Tang, who is also a legislator, called for more efforts to help cross-border students to adapt to studies and life in Hong Kong after returning to school. Many schools are ready to help cross-border students to make up for their delayed online classes, and they may need some psychological counseling to help them readapt to campus life in Hong Kong, Tang said.                          "

COVID-19 related experiments should be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner, and this has always been the standard of the field.  The notice requires disposing and transferring experimental materials for storage when experiments are complete. Transportation of the COVID-19 strains or uncultured samples of potentially infectious biological materials should also be approved by the NHC or Beijing Municipal Health Commission.As part of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission's effort to strengthen security of COVID-19 laboratory biosafety, the notice requires affiliated health departments to obtain a clear picture of how many labs are conducting COVID-19 related experiments and how they conduct experiments, store strains and samples. Local health departments should make a record and supervise their activities to prevent laboratory bio-risks, according to the notice. Laboratories should shoulder their responsibility, conduct thorough risk evaluation and strengthen protection of related personnel, the notice added.This latest notice released by the Beijing Municipal Health Commission is part of the NHC's effort to strengthen COVID-19 laboratory biosafety. The notice to strengthen COVID-19 laboratory biosafety released by NHC on January 17 said the novel coronavirus continues to be managed under the second category of pathogenic microorganisms. COVID-19 cultivation and animal infection experiments should be carried out in a laboratory environment with biosafety level III or above. The handling of uncultured infectious materials and inactivated materials shall be carried out in a biosafety Level II or above laboratory, and the handling of human and animal tissue specimens that have not been reliably inactivated or immobilized shall be carried out in a level III or above laboratory, the NHC said in the notice.The NHC's notice specified that the virus strains should be sent to a storage facility for holding or be promptly destroyed at the end of the experimental activities. Infectious samples should be destroyed or inactivated immediately after experiments are concluded.It also highlighted that newly mutated strains isolated from a laboratory environment should be sent to a storage facility within 90 days for safekeeping, the NHC said.""It is not the first time that the country mentioned the biosecurity of labs. Scientific projects on biosecurity should be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner.

The new semester of most Australian universities and other universities in the Southern Hemisphere will start in late February or early March. This will surely help the Australian education sector recover and boost the comprehensive Australian economic development, Chinese education insiders told the Global Times.The Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange (CSCSE) under China's Ministry of Education issued an announcement on Saturday, saying that it had made the decision to cancel the special degree certification rules during the pandemic in order to effectively protect the interests of overseas students and maintain educational equity.The center said it will no longer recognize overseas degrees obtained via online learning except in special circumstances, and it urged students to return to their overseas campuses as soon as possible.""We can't wait to celebrate the return of our students to campus for Semester 1, and are planning accordingly,"" a spokesperson of the University of Sydney told Global Times on Monday via email.The spokesperson said that the university staff expects the vast majority of students, including international students, to be on campus for the Semester 1 (February 20).The spokesperson noted that the school is aware of the logistical challenges for the students, particularly around visa processing, travel availability and accommodation, and they will continue consulting with the sector, governments and providers as required.The university will also continue to provide remote offerings wherever possible for offshore international students who are unable to return to Australia. However, the delivery of on-campus units remotely will be banned and pre-pandemic face-to-face teaching modes will return from September 2, according to the spokesperson.Also, Professor Sharon Pickering, deputy vice chancellor (education) and senior vice-president of Monash University in Australia, told the Global Times on Tuesday via email that ""we welcome China's decision to encourage students to return to Australia and will work closely with the Australian government to ensure their smooth return.""""International students are an important part of the Monash community. Not only do they provide a global perspective to our entire student experience, they add vitality to our campuses, and to the broader Victorian community,"" the university noted.""We're really looking forward to welcoming all our students back to our campuses next month, so they will be able to engage with other students and staff face-to-face and make the most of all that campus life has to offer,"" a University of Melbourne spokesperson told the Global Times on Tuesday.A spokesperson for the University of Queensland expressed similar anticipation for welcoming the return of international students to campus and will continue to support students who may face challenges returning to onshore study.During the pandemic, the loss of Chinese students was a great economic shock to Australia, which is suffering from severe stagflation, and the return of Chinese students may be the ""key to recovery,"" Chinese observers pointed out.International education is Australia's fourth-largest foreign exchange earner, and China sends the largest number of international students, media reports have said.Last year, Australian universities faced severe financial difficulties and had to reduce pay, cut teachers and employees, and drop some disciplines, Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Chen listed some of the main factors behind the strong anticipation from the Australian education sector to welcome more Chinese students back.More than just boosting the international education industry by paying tuition fees, Chinese students can bring comprehensive economic benefits and social development to Australia through hospitality consumption, travel, accommodation renting and home buying as well as working after graduation, Chen said.Australia has long been one of the top destinations for Chinese students due to its fine education quality and cultural diversity, the observer noted.A 26-year-old postgraduate student surnamed Tong of the University of Sydney is busy booking a flight and student accommodation after learning of the notice from the Chinese education authority. She told the Global Times that she was a bit pressed for time but hopefully she could arrive in Australia before the start of the new semester. A couple of other Chinese students of Australian universities expressed their excitement at taking face-to-face courses, but they also noted the time constraints to go through the procedures.After learning of the challenges, the CSCSE made a further statement on Sunday offering some more flexibility for students returning to Australia and other nations.For example, an exception is being made for Chinese students who have too little time to apply for visas, book flights and accommodation if this semester is about to start or has already started. The center said those students can continue online courses while going through the procedures. In case of visa rejections, flight cancellations or inability to make dormitory reservations, it is recommended to keep relevant documents and submit them with the degree application for certification, so as to successfully pass the certification, said the center.

Whisking away the Chinese New Year travel rush's risk for the city, the official also said Beijing is set to conduct an investigation of its population's serum antibody levels during February and March, for reference for future COVID-19 control. 
",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/daaf9dae-ca18-4fae-83cc-c47ec264ac38.jpeg," An official from the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Beijing CDC) said the capital's COVID-19 infection is drawing to a close, thanks to temporary immunity built during the infection peak. Whisking away the Chinese New Year travel rush's risk for the city, the official also said Beijing is set to conduct an investigation of its population's serum antibody levels during February and March, for reference for future COVID-19 control. From January 23 to 29, patients with flu-like symptoms received by key Beijing hospitals fell 40.87 percent week-on-week and 84.53 percent year-on-year, Wang Quanyi, deputy head of Beijing's CDC, told the Beijing News on Tuesday. He noted that Beijing took samples from 453 patients with flu-like symptoms, 23 of which were positive for novel coronavirus.The official whisked away the risk of Chinese New Year travel on the capital. Wang said that temporary immunity was built among the population during the outbreak at the end of last year, so an outbreak is unlikely for at least another three months. In an interview with the Global Times previously, Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist of the Chinese CDC, said that it is estimated that 80 percent of the capital's population was infected with COVID-19 during the recent exit wave, thus a robust hybrid immunity generated by natural infection and vaccines has already formed. Beijing CDC's Wang also said that the capital is set to conduct serum antibody investigation for novel coronavirus during February and March this year. A total of roughly 5,000 people will be randomly chosen in all of Beijing's sub-districts, requiring information of their nucleic acid and vaccination status, to complete the investigation.Wang said that as time passes, the level of antibodies will also drop, thus a dynamic evaluation will be needed in the future.An expert from the Chinese CDC, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the serum antibody investigation should be conducted nationwide to get a full picture of infection among the country's population. ""Such an investigation will answer some important questions, for example, how many are asymptomatic, as well as the antibody levels of people inoculated with different vaccines. If the sample is big enough, it will also tell us the proportion of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms and even the number of deaths,"" the expert said. The expert said that immunity generated by natural infection will fade within five or six months, according to international data, but it will protect people from suffering from severe symptoms or death for a long time.""This [serum antibody] is important for the country to prepare for any further outbreak. The next wave won't overwhelm the medical system, but it will help us better prepare for the next wave and possible other endemic to come,"" said the anonymous CDC expert.Wang also said that Beijing is set to reinforce monitoring of variants of coronavirus in the near future, including checking inbound travelers and people within the city. As for people entering the country via the capital, Wang said the customs office will check those with COVID-like symptoms. If their CT value is lower than 32, their samples will be sent to the CDC for genetic sequencing.Key Beijing hospitals will keep reporting patients with flu-like symptoms, and currently there are 39 hospitals conducting pathogenic detection. The data from hospitals can help authorities get a grip on infection numbers and how wide the infection is, so the relevant government bodies can respond, said Wang. The anonymous CDC expert said that nationwide, the CDC is monitoring the activity of COVID-19 and mutations of the virus, and also pushing for vaccination, especially for the elderly with underlying diseases.                          "

One staff member told the Global Times that it was ""the busiest day"" they had had for a long time.The street has been welcoming drinkers for 28 years. Cui, a 52-year-old resident who lives near the street, told the Global Times that it was an iconic landmark. Whenever her husband met clients, Cui said, the bars on the street were always the first option.""The closure of the street is actually a closure of my memories of being young,"" she added.Wang Laohu, a regular guest on the street told the Global Times that he came specially today after hearing the street would be closed soon.""Those bars gave me the biggest mental entertainment,"" he said, explaining that catching up with friends for supper after a few drinks here made him happy.Wei Lei, deputy director of the Sanlitun sub-district office, said that the 1990s buildings need to be improved. He also noted that the ""Sanlitun bar street"" brand will remain due to its popularity with visitors.Jiang Xujun, a 40-year-old photo journalist and Beijing local, told the Global Times that he had captured some ""crazy"" moments of the street's ""glory,"" especially in the late 1990s when it was the backbone of the Sanlitun area's entertainment economy.""Close to Beijing's embassy district, those pubs and bars were crammed with foreigners mixing with locals. Popular Bei Piao (Lit: people who come to Beijing for life opportunities) singers held gigs in bars… there are some good old memories,"" Jiang said.Urban planning expert Li Bo told the Global Times that in the last four years, the area has been gradually improving its facilities to provide more contemporary experiences for international visitors.""In my opinion, the bars were outdated. We once had them for promoting the busy and life-loving ambience of Beijing. But people's lifestyles have changed. Now they prefer more authentic and hidden Beijing experiences,"" Li noted.Although some fans like Jiang felt nostalgic, local resident Catherine Peng is happy to see the bars go.""Their noise was so loud that the neighbors often got together to denounce them. We complained and got no feedback,"" she said, adding that she thought the bars were ""low.""Recalling some of the bars' revealing pole dances, Liu Liyang, another resident, told the Global Times that she hoped some ""elegant"" shops would take their place.As part of the Sanlitun area's overall improvement, Wei said that catering businesses like cafés and healthy food companies will replace bars on the street to meet consumers' demand.Prior to the Sanlitun bar street, Beijing's Shi Chahai, another hot entertainment area, also went through a bar street ""surgery"" in 2017. More than 4,000 square meters of illegal construction, including major bars' roof tops, were demolished.Along with other measures such as banning bars' open-air operations, the area was to be restored to show Beijing's classic and historical aesthetics.

People all over the world, leaders of other countries and international friends in various fields have also expressed their heartfelt condolences.Comrade Jiang Zemin was an outstanding leader enjoying high prestige acknowledged by the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, a great Marxist, a great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, military strategist and diplomat, a long-tested communist fighter, and an outstanding leader of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. He was the core of the Party's third generation of central collective leadership and the principal founder of the Theory of Three Represents.We hold Comrade Jiang Zemin in high esteem, and cherish the memory of Comrade Jiang Zemin because he devoted his life to the Chinese people, and worked tirelessly throughout his life to contribute to the cause of national independence and the liberation of the people, and to the prosperity of our country and the well-being of our people. In particular, the great achievements of our Party and the country in the 13 years following the fourth plenary session of the 13th Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee are inseparable from Comrade Jiang Zemin's great talent, bold vision, key role, and exceptional art of political leadership. The immortal feats Comrade Jiang Zemin had accomplished for the Party and the people won him the heartfelt love and esteem of the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, as well as the wide acclaim of the international community!Comrades and friends!Ever since his adolescent years, Comrade Jiang Zemin had committed himself to seeking truth and actively involved himself in the people's revolutionary movements. He was from Yangzhou City in Jiangsu Province. Born into a patriotic intellectual family in August 1926, he was enlightened by patriotism and the ideas of the democratic revolution from a young age. In the winter of 1943, he took part in patriotic progressive student movements led by underground CPC organizations. In April 1946, he joined the CPC and had since devoted all his life to the Party and the people.After the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC), Comrade Jiang Zemin had successively worked at enterprises, scientific research institutions, and state ministries and commissions. He was dedicated, responsible and hardworking at each and every post he was assigned to, and devoted his prime years to the cause of socialist revolution and construction. He did a lot of pioneering work for the endeavor of reform and opening-up. At the 12th CPC National Congress, he was elected member of the CPC Central Committee.Starting from 1985, Comrade Jiang Zemin served as mayor of Shanghai, deputy secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, and then secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee. He led the work to chart the course for the city's economic development and urban construction, and put forward the goal of building Shanghai into a socialist modern city that is open, multifunctional, industrially well-structured, scientifically and technologically advanced, and culturally advanced by the end of the 20th century. He stressed building Pudong into a world-class new urban area that can serve as a modern international hub. He also pushed for institutional arrangements to address the people's practical concerns. He had made outstanding contributions to helping Shanghai open new ground in reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive. He was elected member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the first plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee. In the late spring and early summer of 1989, a severe political disturbance took place in China. Comrade Jiang Zemin resolutely upheld and implemented the CPC Central Committee's correct decision on taking a clear stand against the turmoil, defending China's socialist state power and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people, and effectively maintained the stability of Shanghai by relying on the solid support of Party members, cadres and the masses.Comrades and friends!In June 1989, Comrade Jiang Zemin was elected member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and general secretary of the CPC Central Committee at the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee. In November that year, at the fifth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, it was decided that he would serve as the chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the CPC. The Party's third generation of central collective leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core took shape.At the time when Comrade Jiang Zemin assumed principal leading posts in the Party and the military, China was at a critical moment, facing both pressure from abroad and difficulties at home. Comrade Jiang Zemin took charge at a challenging time. ""For the cause of the Party and the people, I would give my best, give my all, till my heart ceases to beat,"" Comrade Jiang Zemin had said with a strong resolve.Between the late 1980s and early 1990s, political disturbances erupted in the international arena and in China. World socialism experienced serious twists and turns. Some Western countries imposed so-called ""sanctions"" on China. The development of China's socialist cause faced unprecedented difficulties and pressures. At this historical juncture critical to the future and destiny of the Party and the state, Comrade Jiang Zemin led the central collective leadership of the CPC -- which firmly relied on the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups -- in unswervingly taking economic development as the central task, unequivocally upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, adhering to reform and opening-up, resolutely carrying out rectifications and strengthening ideological work in all respects. He also led the leadership in furthering the efforts to improve Party conduct, build clean government and fight corruption, in strengthening the Party's ties with the masses, and in actively carrying out diplomatic struggles and resolutely safeguarding national independence, dignity, security and stability. All these safeguarded the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. After painstaking efforts, the Party and the people successfully stabilized the general situation of reform and development, laying a solid foundation for our country's development.During the 13 years between the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee and the 16th CPC National Congress, China's reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive unfolded with great momentum amid a highly volatile international situation.In a complex environment both abroad and at home, Comrade Jiang Zemin led the central collective leadership of the CPC in holding high the great banners of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, unswervingly adhering to the Party's basic line, and firmly relying on the whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward the basic principle of seizing opportunities, deepening the reform and opening China wider to the outside world, promoting development and maintaining stability. He expounded on the 12 major relationships that should be properly handled in boosting socialist modernization, which deepened our understanding of the laws that underlie socialist modernization.Stressing the importance of seizing opportunities without fail, and blazing new trails instead of following the beaten track, he led the formulation and implementation of a raft of principles, policies and major strategies to promote reform, development and stability. He led the establishment of the Party's basic program for the primary stage of socialism, providing strong guidance for upholding and developing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.He led us in defining building a socialist market economy as an objective of reform and setting a basic framework in this regard, and establishing a basic economic system for the primary stage of socialism under which public ownership is the mainstay and diverse forms of ownership develop together, as well as an income distribution system under which distribution according to work is the mainstay while multiple forms of distribution exist alongside. He led efforts to advance economic and political structural reforms as well as reforms in the cultural sector and other fields.Comrade Jiang Zemin engaged in forward-looking strategic thinking on building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and attaining the third-step strategic objectives for the modernization drive. He pointed out that efforts should be concentrated on fully building a moderately prosperous society of a higher standard for the benefit of well over 1 billion people in the first two decades of the 21st century.He stressed that confidence is derived from prosperity while backwardness makes a country vulnerable to attack. It is essential for the Party to give top priority to development in governing and rejuvenating the country, and focus wholeheartedly on developing the economy and pursuing development. He proposed a combination of bringing in foreign investments and going global, and the promotion of reform and development through opening-up. He led China in joining the World Trade Organization and reaching a new stage of opening-up.He led us in developing socialist democracy, implementing the rule of law as a basic strategy, developing advanced socialist culture, realizing the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao, pushing for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to reach the 1992 Consensus embodying the one-China principle, and making major moves to fight against separatists and oppose ""Taiwan independence.""He remained committed to developing keen insights into the overall trend of the changing global situation with a global vision, and put forward a series of thoughts on diplomacy and international strategies. He actively promoted the building of a multipolar world, pushed for greater democracy in international relations, respected the diversity of the world, pushed for the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and led us in breaking new ground on the diplomatic front.He stressed that to do a good job of governing the country, we must first do a good job of governing the Party, and that means governing it strictly. He underscored commitment to study, political integrity, and rectitude, and the advancement of the great new project of Party building. He stressed the need to resolve two historical problems, namely improving the Party's performance in leadership and governance, and increasing its ability to resist corruption, prevent degeneration and ward off risks. He stressed the need to unswervingly improve conduct, build integrity, and combat corruption, always maintain the vigor and vitality, dashing spirit and integrity as communists, and always maintain the Party's advanced and pure nature.He led us in properly handling the relations between reform, development and stability, making impressive and new progress in material, political and cultural-ethical advancement and Party building, and successfully advancing socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century.Comrade Jiang Zemin had a thorough understanding of the development trend of the new military transformation taking place in the world and led the formulation of the military strategy in a new period. He stressed the necessity of advancing military transformation with Chinese characteristics, unswervingly adhering to a Chinese approach of having fewer but better troops, and making them more revolutionary, modern and standardized. ""To put it in a nutshell, the issues that I have concentrated on in recent years are whether the armed forces could fight to win while never degrading in character,"" he said.He underscored unswervingly upholding the Party's absolute leadership over the people's military, adding that the armed forces should be qualified politically and competent militarily and have fine conduct, strict discipline and guaranteed support. They should preserve their nature, character and fine conduct as the people's armed forces.Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed placing the focal point of military preparedness on winning local wars in the information age, and speeding up the development of national defense and weaponry and equipment. He made the strategic decision to stop military and armed police units, as well as judicial, procuratorial and public security organs from doing business. Thanks to Comrade Jiang Zemin's leadership and efforts, great achievements had been made in modernizing the national defense and the armed forces.Committed to emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, advancing with the times, and respecting the practice and the people, Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward a series of new ideas, viewpoints and judgments on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and made outstanding contributions to upholding and developing the Party's basic theory, line, program and experience. In particular, by pooling the wisdom of the whole Party, he formulated the Theory of Three Represents, which further answers the questions of what socialism is and how to build it, and creatively addresses what kind of Party to build and how to build it. The Theory of Three Represents has deepened our understanding of rules to advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthen Party building in the new conditions. With its new ideas, viewpoints and judgments, it serves as a continuation, enrichment and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.In the 13 years following the fourth plenary session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, Comrade Jiang Zemin led us in effectively tackling a series of international emergencies concerning China's sovereignty and security, overcoming difficulties and risks cropping up in the political and economic spheres and those brought by natural disasters, and in particular, successfully coping with the impact of the Asian financial crisis and winning a victory in the disaster relief efforts during the devastating floods in 1998, thus guaranteeing that the great ship of China's reform, opening-up, and socialist modernization forges ahead on the right track.Comrade Jiang Zemin attached great importance to the major strategic issues that were vital to the cause of the Party and the people. When preparing for the 16th CPC National Congress, he proposed that he would no longer serve in the central leading posts and that he would retire from the CPC Central Committee to facilitate the leadership transition of the Party and the state. The CPC Central Committee accepted his proposal. In 2004, he offered to retire from his posts as chairman of the CMC of the CPC and chairman of the CMC of the PRC, which fully displays his great foresight for the development of the cause of the Party and the state.After retiring from leadership posts, Comrade Jiang Zemin firmly upheld the work of the CPC Central Committee and gave it his support. He cared for the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and resolutely supported the efforts to improve Party conduct and combat corruption. In 2006, Comrade Jiang Zemin was personally in charge of editing and finalizing the first, second and third volumes of ""Selected Works of Jiang Zemin."" These works are a major textbook that we can use to advance the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the great new project of Party building.Comrade Jiang Zemin developed a distinctive revolutionary spirit and demeanor through long years of revolutionary practice. Comrade Jiang Zemin was far-sighted, and could make correct assessments of different situations. He always observed and reflected on issues by taking into consideration the general development trends of China and the world, as well as the overall work of the Party and the state, continuously advancing theoretical innovation and innovation in other fields.Comrade Jiang Zemin was firm in his convictions and decisive in his actions. He always put the Party and the people first, and unswervingly adhered to the ideals and beliefs of communists. At critical moments, Comrade Jiang Zemin had the great courage to make resolute decisions and theoretical innovation. He valued practice and kept pace with the times. He always grasped the trends and opportunities of the times, summarizing experience and seeking new ways based on the vibrant practice of the Party and the people, thus advancing the work of the Party and the state in a down-to-earth yet enterprising manner.Comrade Jiang Zemin respected and cared for the people, always paying great attention to their security and well-being, and assessing and advancing work based on the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people. The distinctive revolutionary spirit and demeanor of Comrade Jiang Zemin will remain immortal in our hearts and will always educate and motivate us on the way forward.The passing of Comrade Jiang Zemin is an inestimable loss to our Party, our military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. The CPC Central Committee calls on the whole Party, the entire military and the people of all ethnic groups to turn grief into strength, carry forward Comrade Jiang Zemin's legacy, mourn his passing with concrete actions, and write new chapters in the development of the cause of the Party and the country on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.-- Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology upon which our Party and our country are founded and thrive. The most valuable asset Comrade Jiang Zemin left us is the Theory of Three Represents. He said: ""I raised this after a long period of thinking."" ""The thought of Three Represents didn't spring fully-formed into existence, but had been the result of 13 years of theoretical and practical explorations and trail-blazing."" The Theory of Three Represents is a guiding ideology that the Party must adhere to on a long-term basis. On the new journey, we must adapt the basic tenets of Marxism to China's specific realities and its fine traditional culture. We must proceed from reality, keep responding to the questions posed by China, by the world, by the people, and by the times, and ensure that Marxism always retains its vigor and vitality.-- The leadership of the CPC is the fundamental guarantee for the cause of the Party and the people to go forward in spite of all difficulties. Comrade Jiang Zemin once said, ""as a veteran CPC member, I sincerely hope that all CPC members, especially comrades in the central leadership, always put the Party first and always consciously uphold and maintain the CPC leadership in various fields of work. This is where the hope of the Party and the country lies."" On the new journey, we must always stay sober and determined. We must enhance the Four Consciousnesses, reinforce the Four-Sphere Confidence, and ensure the Two Upholds. We must carry forward the great founding spirit of the Party, stay true to our founding mission, have the courage to advance self-reform, and see that the Party always serves as the strong leadership core in the course of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.-- The path of socialism with Chinese characteristics will allow China to catch up with the times in great strides and play a leading role. In 2001, at the ceremony marking the Party's 80th anniversary, Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized in his speech that the practice over the past 80 years had taught us we must unswervingly adhere to our own path, which was the most fundamental experience we gain from summarizing the Party's history. On the new journey, we must stick to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the Party's basic theory, basic line, and basic policy, stay confident and build strength, uphold fundamental principles and break new ground. We must keep moving confidently forward in broad strides along the right path that we have chosen for ourselves, and advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization.-- The people are the fundamental force that determines the future of our Party and our country. Comrade Jiang Zemin was utterly loyal to the people, and had always put the people in his heart. He put forward the idea of putting the people first, and repeatedly stressed that it is a basic viewpoint of Marxism to consider the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people as the most critical and decisive factor, and that we must realize, safeguard, and advance the fundamental interests of the greatest possible majority of the Chinese people. On the new journey, we must put the people front and center, serve the people wholeheartedly, apply a people-centered development philosophy, develop whole-process people's democracy, and maintain close ties with the people. We must breathe the same air as the people, share the same future, stay truly connected to them, and make more notable and substantive progress toward achieving well-rounded human development and common prosperity for all.-- Reform and opening-up is a crucial move in determining the future and destiny of contemporary China. ""We should promote institutional innovation, technological innovation, cultural innovation and innovation in other aspects through theoretical innovation, and make explorations and advances amid practices, without ever getting complacent or slackening our efforts. That is the way of governing the Party and the state that entails long-term adherence,"" Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed. On the new journey, we must accurately identify changes, adeptly respond to them, and work to steer them in our favor. We must apply the new development philosophy, create a new pattern of development, and promote high-quality development. We must comprehensively promote reform and opening-up, constantly improve the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and advance the modernization of the state governance system and capacity so as to gain the edge, seize the initiative and embrace a good future.-- China cannot develop without the rest of the world, and the world needs China for prosperity. Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed that we must adjust ourselves to the historical trends, promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is just and reasonable, strive for a long-term peaceful international environment, comprehensively safeguard our national security and interests, and constantly make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of humankind's peace and development. On the new journey, we must always keep global well-being in mind, holding high the banner of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit and promoting the common values shared by humankind. Efforts should be made to jointly advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, facilitate the establishment of a new type of international relations, push forward the building of a community of shared future for humankind, and join hands and press ahead with all the progressive forces in the world.-- Having the courage to fight and the mettle to win is an invincible source of inspiration for the CPC and the Chinese people. Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed, ""Our Party is leading the people in conducting a great struggle of developing socialist modernization, which will be inevitably confronted with many complications. The grave situations both outside and inside the country, and the confrontations and conflicts between different social systems and ideological systems frequently pose challenges to every Party member."" ""We must have the heroic bravery to defeat all the enemies."" ""One cannot bow his or her noble head."" On the new journey, it is imperative for us to race against time and keep striving forward, uphold a fighting spirit to rise to difficulties and grasp the historical initiative. We must foster a firmer sense of purpose, fortitude, and self-belief in the whole Party and among the Chinese people of all ethnic groups so that we cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, or cowed by pressure, and thus dig deep to surmount the difficulties and challenges on the road ahead.Comrades and friends!Comrade Jiang Zemin has parted from us forever. But, his name and reputation, deeds of merit, thoughts and outstanding qualities will go down the annals of history and remain immortal in the hearts of the people from generation to generation. The whole Party, the entire military and the Chinese people of all ethnic groups must rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee, forge ahead with enterprise and fortitude, and strive in unity to build a modern socialist country in all respects and advance the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts.Eternal glory to Comrade Jiang Zemin!

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-08-25/e2ca129d-0d79-4822-b4f3-751553183d49.jpeg," With the stabilized COVID-19 situation across the Taiwan Straits, the Chinese mainland has urged the Taiwan authorities to further restore direct flights across the Straits in a bid to better deliver benefits to compatriots, according to a mainland spokesperson on Wednesday. This reflects the high anticipation of people across the Straits for personnel exchanges, observers said.To restore direct flights would be a milestone to greatly facilitate the circulation of goods and people exchanges and cooperation across the Straits, which is especially conducive to the recovery of the local economy and people's livelihoods, as the island's economy remains under pressure, said mainland observers. But they said that the process of restoring direct flights is likely to be very ""bumpy and tortuous"" given that the Tsai administration has been blocking cross-Straits exchanges during recent years.As the COVID-19 situations on the mainland and in Taiwan have both stabilized, it is an opportune time to further restore the normal operations of flights between the two sides, said Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, citing correspondence from the mainland's aviation authorities to the Taiwan side.""We hope that Taiwan can work together with the mainland for the resumption of normal cross-Straits flights,"" she said, suggesting that the resumption of direct flights to 16 mainland destinations should be prioritized, including South China's city of Guangzhou, based on the requests of Taiwan compatriots.""We hope Taiwan authorities will make pragmatic and continuous efforts to help resume the normal operations of direct cross-Straits flights, and deliver benefits to compatriots on both sides of the Straits,"" Zhu said.Many people who have insight into the Taiwan island have urged the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities to cooperate with Beijing to further resume personnel exchanges and serve the people's interests.""Please give peace across the Taiwan Straits a chance and Taiwan a way to live in the future,"" Hung Hsiu-chu, former chairwoman of the Kuomintang in Taiwan, said on Facebook on Saturday. She said that the cold winter of the epidemic has dissipated and the cross-Straits deadlock should be eased as well. She hopes the DPP authorities will stop using all means to obstruct cross-Straits exchanges and stop ignoring the rights and interests of Taiwan businesspeople.There are millions of Taiwan businessmen and compatriots on the mainland, and they need a peaceful and stable environment across the Straits, Hung said after she visited Xiamen for discussions with Taiwan businessmen during the Spring Festival holidays.Wang Kwo-tsai, senior official of the transportation and communications authority in the island, said on Tuesday that the island has set a goal of attracting 6 million overseas travelers this year, 1 million of whom would be mainland residents, Taiwan media reported. On the same day, Taiwan vowed to cancel PCR sampling for COVID-19 tests from inbound passengers from the mainland as of February 7, but arrivals still need to undergo a seven-day period of self-initiated prevention, according to the Taiwan health department.A Taiwan resident surnamed Chu who travels between Shanghai and Taipei for business told the Global Times that, for Taiwan residents living in Shanghai, they can take direct flights to the island. But it will be good news for residents in other cities, especially for those involved in cross-Straits marriages, Chu said.Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen and Chengdu have always supported direct flights, but the number is limited and fares are high. For example, the round trip between Shanghai and Taipei costs about 3,600 yuan ($534), Chu said. The cross-Straits shipping and flight services will facilitate exchanges between people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, based on the one-China principle. However, since cross-Straits relations took a turn for the worse after Tsai Ing-wen took office in the island, coupled with the pandemic, there are only four direct flight destinations on the mainland, and most flights are basically suspended, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Thursday.To resume direct flights will surely signal the easing and improvement of cross-Straits relations, and show that the mainland hopes to continue to promote the integrated development of the two sides, the observer noted.However, considering the past moves by the DDP authorities to block cross-Straits exchanges, it is likely to be a ""bumpy and tortuous"" process to resume direct flights to the 16 mainland destinations, Xin pointed out.To restore direct flights requires goodwill and support from the mainland and cooperation from the Taiwan authorities. But Tsai has always been stigmatizing and demonizing exchanges between the two sides as the re-warming of cross-Straits ties goes against her intention to seek ""Taiwan independence.""Ferries between Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen and the mainland city of Xiamen restarted on January 7 after a hiatus of almost three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But the current resumption of services with Kinmen and Matsu has been scheduled to last only until February 6, and it's restricted to residents of the two small Taiwan islands, mainland spouses and students studying in Kinmen, media reports said.

Wetlands play an important role in conserving and purifying water, storing floodwater for use against drought, regulating the climate and maintaining biodiversity, which cannot be replaced by other ecosystems. Wetlands are an extremely precious natural resource to maintain the security of the environment, food and water resources.The 18 wetlands added in China are located in Beijing, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and East China's Jiangsu Province, among others, officials said at an event in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province on Thursday. The ecological status of ""Wetlands of International Importance"" remains stable on the whole, according to a wetland monitoring report issued at the event. The total area of wetlands increased from the previous year, with water quality improved and water supplies remaining stable. Meanwhile, the species richness, a single facet of biodiversity, has improved, with 2,391 species of wetland plants distributed among the wetlands. The conservation and restoration work of wetlands achieved remarkable results, with degraded wetlands in Heilongjiang, Hubei, Shandong and Hainan provinces effectively restored. Appreciating China's leadership role at COP14, Musonda Mumba, secretary general of the Ramsar Convention, said that China has continued to improve its legal and policy frameworks, implemented China's Wetlands Conservation Law and the National Wetland Protection Plan (2022-30), and strengthened the protection and management of domestic wetlands. Since joining the Ramsar Convention in 1992, China has taken active responses to global challenges such as wetland area reduction and degradation of ecological functions. During the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20), China invested 9.87 billion yuan ($1.46 billion) to implement 53 wetland protection and restoration projects, and there were more than 2,000 subsidy programs for wetland compensation, converting cultivated land into wetlands, as well as wetland protection and restoration. A total of 467,400 ha of degraded wetlands were restored and the area of wetlands was increased by 202,600 hectares.As an important participant, contributor and leader of global wetland conservation and restoration, China vows to actively fulfill its obligations under the convention, continue to strengthen the protection of the authenticity and integrity of wetlands, implement the national wetland protection plan and carry out major wetland protection projects, as well as include more important wetlands in the management of protected natural areas and improve the platforms for international exchanges and cooperation. Global Times                          "

Should personnel have such travel history, the Hong Kong and Macao SARs will be responsible for checking their testing results acquired within 48 hours before entering the mainland, and those with negative results could enter the mainland, according to the announcement. Children aged 3 years and under are exempt from nucleic acid testing.Upon arrival, people from Hong Kong and Macao SARs shall complete the necessary Customs clearance procedures before entering the mainland. Persons with abnormal health conditions or fever and other symptoms shall be tested by the Customs. Those who test positive can be quarantined at home or seek medical treatment after entry into the mainland, said the authorities.After the authorities announced the full resumption of people-to-people exchanges between the mainland and the SARs, Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee announced scrapping nucleic acid test requirements and reopening three land ports - Luohu, Liantang and Huanggang - starting from February 6. The port of Sha Tau Kok will also resume cargo services.Also starting from February 6, all the international arrivals to Hong Kong will no longer be required to present vaccination records as Hong Kong fully reopens.Lee said the full resumption of cross-border travel between Hong Kong and the mainland will further boost people-to-people exchanges and business activities.

Jia called for more attention to the possibility of AD occurring in younger people, which will become a challenging issue in the future.The patient developed memory disorders at 17 years old and was then diagnosed with AD at 19. The patient first began to have difficulty concentrating on learning. One year later, the patient suffered significant short-term memory loss, an inability to recall the previous day's events or where personal belongings were stored, as well as difficulty reading and slow reactions, according to Jia's team.Later the patient continued to suffer gradual memory decline, even struggling to remember having eaten. As a result, the patient had to drop out of high school. The gender of the patient is unknown.Jia's team said that the patient has no family history of AD and no other causes of memory impairment such as genetic issues, infections or other diseases.Since the first case of AD was reported in 1906, it has been widely believed that AD mainly occurs in the elderly. AD is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with slow onset and gradual loss of cognition, memory and speech and an increase in mental disorders over time, eventually leading to inability to take care of oneself. It is currently difficult to treat the disease.There are two types of AD, familial and sporadic, Peng Dantao, chief physician of the Neurology Department of the China-Japan Friendship Hospital told the Global Times.About 15 percent of AD patients have the familial type and the age of onset is generally when people are in their 50s. Very few develop symptoms in their 20 or 30s. Most AD cases are sporadic, and it is most common in people over 65. It affects about a fifth of those over 80, Peng said.More than 50 million elderly people in China have cognitive impairment, including more than 15 million with AD, according to Jia's team.Global Times                         "

The news comes amid recent calls for the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities to resume normal cross-Straits direct flights to facilitate exchanges with the mainland.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-03-20/09cd9daa-5560-4af1-a9cc-53d580ca6d05.jpeg," Over the past three pandemic-hit years, the number of cross-Straits marriages has dropped by more than 70 percent, the Global Times learned from figures offered by a cross-Straits marriage affairs insider on Friday. The news comes amid recent calls for the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities to resume normal cross-Straits direct flights to facilitate exchanges with the mainland.Analysts said that the DPP's ""anti-mainland"" manipulation during the pandemic has impacted cross-Straits marriages, which had already been impeded by various unfair policies on the island. They called on the DPP to learn from its defeat in local elections and give priority to people's livelihoods and peace across the Taiwan Straits.According to Taiwan authorities, the number of cross-Straits marriages continued to increase after the resumption of people-to-people exchanges in 1987, reaching a peak of 34,109 in 2003, accounting for 20 percent of all marriages in Taiwan that year. However, the number has since decreased year by year, falling below 10,000 in 2014. Only 6,800 couples were registered in 2018, and the number dropped to 6,262 in 2019.Chong Chin-ming, head of the Chinese Cross-Straits Marriages Coordination and Promotion Association, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview on Friday that in 2020, more than 1,600 marriages were registered across the Straits. The number fell to a historic low of 1,453 in 2021 and bounced back a bit in 2022 with more than 2,000.Since the outbreak of the epidemic, DPP authorities have engaged in political manipulation under the pretext of COVID response. Since February 2020, DPP authorities have unilaterally banned mainland residents from visiting Taiwan and canceled direct flights, severely disrupting normal personnel exchanges. This has impeded cross-Straits couples from registering in Taiwan, and prevented many cross-Straits family reunions.Chong's association began after that to actively help cross-Straits families cope with such problems. As the outbreak subsided, he felt that more and more political manipulation is the main obstruction instead of the virus.Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Wednesday that the mainland aviation authorities have followed existing channels to urge Taiwan authorities to , noting that the epidemic situation on both sides has stabilized, which is a favorable opportunity to resume the normal operation of cross-Straits air routes.The DPP is thinking about its own electoral interests, said Chong. ""But they do not put the well-being of the majority of people first, and confrontation with the mainland only leads to misunderstanding and hostility between the two sides.""The deterioration of cross-Straits relations has also highlighted the unfair treatment of mainland spouses in Taiwan, which has long been ignored.According to Chong, more than 350,000 cross-Straits families were formed in the past decades, but the Taiwan authorities have imposed several obstructions on mainland spouses, which is in fact the overwhelming factor in declining cross-Straits marriages.For instance, he said that after marriage registration, mainland spouses in Taiwan need to go through a six-year process to obtain the ""settlement ID card"" needed to live and work in Taiwan. In the process, there are frequent inspections, reviews and interviews with authorities.Taiwan authorities' policy obstruction is also a major cause of divorce among cross-Straits couples, According to Chong. He told the Global Times that there about 4,000 cross-Straits couples got divorced in 2022. Some couples may live separately sometimes due to work reasons, which gives an opportunity for Taiwan authorities to question the authenticity of the marriage. Sometimes they even force mainland spouses to leave the region and revoke their residence status, said Chong. ""Some marriages were broken up in that way.""When it comes to cross-Straits marriage, the Taiwan authorities should not set such unfair obstructions, as the island and the mainland share the same language and culture, and can quickly blend into each other's environment, Chong said.It should be noted that, according to the statistics of the Taiwan authorities, the proportion of Taiwan women marrying mainland men has been increasing. Many couples choose to live in the mainland, so they are no longer registered in Taiwan.The economic conditions of the mainland are better, and the mainland market is much larger with better international integration, Chong said. ""The mainland has friendly and generous policies toward Taiwan compatriots, and they will no doubt have broader prospects in the mainland.""Unlike Taiwan, the mainland has a more open and supportive attitude towards cross-Straits marriage, he added.

It was detected through genome sequencing of a sample collected on November 10, 2022 from an imported case from Thailand, the Chinese CDC said on its official WeChat account. As of January 30, 2023, a total of 24 imported cases of CH.1.1 variant and its subvariants have been detected throughout the mainland. The sources of these imported cases involve 15 overseas countries and regions. So far, no local infections of CH.1.1 and its subvariants have been detected on the Chinese mainland, according to the Chinese CDC. Despite that the immune escape capacity and transmission advantage of CH.1.1 variant have further enhanced and can lead to an increasing risk of breakthrough infection and reinfection, the variant will not cause large-scale domestic transmission in the short term since the majority of China's population has already obtained high levels of neutralizing antibodies, which provide certain cross-protection effect against CH.1.1, the Chinese CDC noted. However, the vulnerable groups including those aged 65 or above, those who have underlying diseases, and those who have not been vaccinated, as well as those who have not been infected of COVID-19, still need to strengthen personal protection, the Chinese CDC said, reminding the public to persist in personal protection and good hygiene habits.According to the Chinese CDC, CH.1.1 is the sixth-generation sub-lineage of Omicron BA.2.75. The latest researches have shown that the immune escape capacity of CH.1.1 has strengthened due to the increase of multiple substitutions, among which, the L452R substitution was the characteristic substitution of Delta variant. It is also noteworthy that the L452R substitution also exists in many other Omicron variants and subvariants such as BA.5.3 and BA.5.1.3. Since November of 2022, the proportion of CH.1.1 in the prevailing mutant strains in the US has been rising. As of the fourth week of 2023, the proportion of CH.1.1 in the prevailing mutant strains in the US has ranked the fifth, following XBB.1.5, BQ.1.1, BQ.1 and XBB variants. The Chinese CDC said that no enhancement of the virulence of CH.1.1 variant has been observed at present, but further monitoring is still needed. Usually, after the emergence of a new variant, the number of infections needs to reach a certain scale and continues for a period of time to determine whether the virulence of the new variant has changed. Statistics from the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) show that the CH.1.1 was found for the first time in India on July 8, 2022. Over the past month, CH.1.1 variant and its sub-lineages have accounted for over 6 percent in the global lineages recorded. As of January 30, 2023, the CH.1.1 variant has been detected in 67 countries or regions and has become the most prevalent variant in countries including UK, Denmark and Singapore. CH.1.1 variant has accounted for about 25 percent of the COVID-19 sequences uploaded in the UK over the last month. Global Times                         "

Zhao appeared on camera and confessed that he was tempted by the gifts during his three years at the rural credit union.In another film released by South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Li Xinyuan, former Party secretary of Guigang, confessed that he was greedy for power and money.From 2003 to 2021, Li took advantage of his positions to provide benefits for individuals and departments and accepted more than 170 million yuan ($25 million) in return, according to the courts.

The next wave won't overwhelm the medical system and won't have as many as severe cases, the anonymous CDC expert told the Global Times.In a bid to deal with the next wave, many provinces have started to conduct antibody investigations, and some provinces have set up mobile apps to collect antigen testing results provided by the public where people can upload their testing results on a voluntary basis. As the Spring Festival and Lantern Festival holidays are drawing to a close, schools across the country will begin to resume classes. The National Health Commission issued a guidance saying that on-site classes in campuses with no record of an epidemic can operate normally but for those where the epidemic is still ongoing, they should be under closed-off management. The presence of negative testing results for entering and exiting universities and schools is not mandatory. Universities are not required to conduct mass nucleic acid testing anymore, but they should set up fever clines that operate 24/7 to handle possible infections, the guidance noted. ""Schools are special places that are crowded and lack conditions for social distancing, so students should remain cautious and wear masks properly to prevent large-scale outbreaks,"" the anonymous CDC expert noted.

The tourism site was crowded with people with almost every restaurant having a long queue of customers waiting for tables. It took at least two to three hours for tourists to line up and reach the major attraction site of Jiuqu Bridge at the center of the tourism spot, which in normal times is just minutes' walk from the entrance, a vivid reflection of tourism heat around the Lantern Festival holiday. A lantern maker based in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, told the Global Times on Sunday that their sales have been much stronger than last year as the pent-up demand unleashed after downgraded epidemic response.""We have sold over 100,000 units of lanterns, mostly themed rabbit or moon, the zodiac animal of the Chinese Lunar Year of 2023, in January, which was a strong rebound compared with just around 40,000 in the same period last year,"" the company's manager said.The lanterns for home decoration are mostly for the domestic market, but they are also looking into overseas market, particularly the neighboring Southeast Asian countries where the Chinese traditional festivals like the Lantern Festival is also popular.An employee from a Beijing-based online vendor selling sweet dumplings also said that they offered yuanxiao with a great variety of flavors from the traditional nuts to chocolate and blueberry flavors. ""The sales boom has started a week ahead, and it's much hotter than last year,"" the person told the Global Times. Meanwhile, data collected by multiple domestic e-commerce websites also showed that consumption during this year's Lantern Festival holiday was particularly heated.According to a recent report sent by Alibaba to the Global Times, searches for ""yuanxiao"" on Tmall Supermarket has surged by 150 percent in the past week compared with the previous week, while sales of the food also surged three times compared with last year.Besides, data revealed by Meituan showed that sales volume of lanterns surged by 130 percent compared with the previous year, while ticket reservations for tourism spots that are related to Lantern Festival keywords like lantern show surged by around 380 percent in the recent week.The boom in Lantern Festival shopping is an extension of the buying spree during the Spring Festival holidays, which saw a 23 percent increase in domestic tourism travels and 11.89 rise in movie box office.Li Changan, a professor from the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Sunday that the booming consumption is a natural phenomenon that is within expectation as the country is ramping up efforts for economic recovery after three years of the epidemic, which curbed market demand.""This is a good start, because consumption, as an important force driving economic growth, is now a very important part of expanding domestic demand and plays a very important role in stabilizing growth and meeting the economic development targets for this year,"" Li said.Yue Xiangyu, an analyst at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times that the ""long-tail effect"" of China's recent consumption boom could be a signal that Chinese people's shopping enthusiasm could last a relatively long period of time, which is a ""positive"" sign.""The recent holiday consumption passion is helpful for lifting medium/small enterprises' confidence in the Chinese economy and increase residents' income, which in turn boosts consumption for the whole year,"" Yue told the Global Times on Sunday.He predicted that China's consumption revenues could grow by about 8 percent this year, compared with a 0.2 percent drop in 2022.Seen from a larger context, the consumption boom is one of the positive signs that signal a sound economic recovery in China this year. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, China's official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) bounced back into the expansion territory in January for the first time since last September, signaling a strong rebound in the production sector. Local governments in China are also beefing up efforts to stimulate economy. At the first meeting convened by local governments in the Year of the Rabbit, most provinces and cities came up with their solutions of promoting local economy. For example, Liuyang of Central China's Hunan Province rolled out 10 measures to promote high-quality development of private economy during the meeting, as well as awarded 871 private enterprises with 100 million yuan ($14.76 million) in total. Yue said that local governments are trying to make up for the losses caused by anti-virus curbs and push economic work back to the normal track by promoting real economy and employment. He said that market projections for this year's China GDP growth stands at about 5.2 percent on average. ""I'm personally a bit more optimistic than the average expectations,"" he said.In addition, both the real estate sector and the platform economy have been in a state of rectification in recent years, and now the related works have basically come to an end, it may further release the growth potential of the leading engines of economic growth, and bring about a greater boost to the annual economic growth, Li said.

These are super cows, capable of producing 18 tons of milk a year and over 100 tons of milk in a lifetime.Jin Yaping, the project's lead, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the breakthrough has great significance for China to concentrate and preserve in an economically feasible way the very best cows in the country, and it is a success in the country's efforts to revitalize its agricultural sector with vital seed and breeder animals.For dairy cows, China is 70 percent reliant on overseas purchases, the press release said.China has roughly 6.6 million cows - the famed highly productive breed Holstein Friesian cattle - that were imported over the years. However, only about five in 10,000 such cattle in China are highly productive, long-lived and stress-resistant at the same time in their living environment in China, factoring in such issues as the climate.Also, some super cows were not identified until nearly the end of their lives and their genes were lost as they died, which is a loss to the country, Jin said. Also, since the cows are scattered among farms across China, breeding becomes technically difficult.Industry insiders revealed that some countries have banned the sales of Holstein Friesian cattle to China, while countries that do sell such cows to China face exhaustion as China rapidly expands the scale of its Holstein Friesian cattle herds with constantly improving demand for dairy products as the ranks of the Chinese middle class swell.By taking some tissue from a cow's ear, scientists led by Jin, in the words of the press release, ""reincarnated"" these super cows, which is a prerequisite for the breeding of China's own super cows.The new method unveiled on Tuesday means that people can preserve the genes of these super cows in a timely manner, produce a concentrated herd of super cows, and provide excellent resources for future breeding and selection of China's proprietary super cows, according to Jin.""Using cloning technology alone won't have any economic meaning, and the combination of tapping reproductive technology and using low-productive cows as surrogates allowed us to reproduce 20 more offspring compared with just using cloning for a given time period,"" Jin said. Among the first batch of 120 cloned embryos, 42 percent were impregnated and about 17.5 percent were still fertile at Day 200, the press release said, stating the further maturity of the technology.In recent years, China has prioritized self-reliance of vital seeds and doubled down on seed technology investment in an effort to beef up its food security. Major breakthroughs are also being achieved in ""bottleneck"" seed sectors such as corn, soybeans, broiler chickens and breeding pigs, helping to further reduce reliance on imports amid rising geopolitical risks.""We plan to take two to three years to build up a herd comprised of over 1,000 super cows, as a solid foundation to tackle China's reliance on overseas dairy cows and the issue of the risk of being 'choked',"" noted Jin.

The CAZG was the first to be informed of Le Le's death, Thompson noted, adding that the Memphis Zoo hopes to receive a younger pair of pandas. The CAZG and the Memphis Zoo launched the giant panda conservation and research project in 2003, with an agreement duration of 10 years, which was extended by 10 more years in 2013. The pair of pandas arrived at the zoo in April 2003. In January this year, the two sides discussed the early return of the two pandas to China due to their rising ages and Ya Ya's skin disease, which made her unsuitable to be exhibited any longer. Although the panda is now elderly, it is still very probable for pandas in captivity to live longer and more healthily, Zhao Songsheng, manager of YueWeiLai, a Chengdu-based NGO dedicated to protecting giant pandas, told the Global Times on Sunday.Zhao suggested a thorough investigation be conducted into the unexpected death of the panda to prevent the politicization of the event due to changes in China-US relations. According to Zhao, the two pandas had been previously exposed by netizens as being improperly fed at the zoo, with stale and insufficient bamboo. The extremely emaciated images of this pair of pandas, which were circulated on the internet over the past few years, also indicated something went wrong. However, the CAZG responded this January to public concerns over panda Ya Ya's physical condition after it organized multiple health assessments of the panda. A comprehensive judgment made by experts from several Chinese panda protection and research institutions and zoos from both China and the US based on videos, monthly health reports, annual physical examinations and other information showed that Ya Ya had no organic disease and was in medium health. The experts also decided the panda at the zoo had received good care and there was no sign of mistreatment. The Chinese Embassy in the US inspected the zoo and confirmed the attentive care the pandas received at the zoo.Many US residents expressed deep sadness toward the death of the giant panda after the zoo mourned its death on social media. ""My daughter was born just a year before Le Le. We live near Memphis and have always taken our kids to see the pandas their whole childhoods. This is so heartbreaking. Rest in peace, sweet Le Le. Thank you for bringing our family joy with all visits to Memphis,"" a US netizen said. Another netizen said that the death of Le Le broke her heart since watching Le Le and Ya Ya on the panda cam had been one of her daily doses of joy. According to Zhao, biodiversity conservation has become a global consensus and the protection of the flagship species of giant pandas for biodiversity conservation is also meant to protect the thousands of species of plants and animals in pandas' habitat.                          "

The government also needs time to restore its capacity to welcome travelers, such as making up for a shortage of tourism employees, who left the industry during the pandemic. The HKSAR launched a six-month campaign on Thursday, with 700,000 air tickets to be given away to boost the tourism sector starting from March. Yiu revealed that those tickets will be prioritized for potential travelers from Southeast Asian countries, and also from the mainland, especially from the Greater Bay Area.Other industries, such as finance and technology innovation, will slowly regain steam as borders fully reopen. Those industries received less of a direct blow from the pandemic, yet the lack of face-to-face communication affected technology teams between Hong Kong and the mainland.Also, Li Xiaobing, an expert on Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan affairs from Nankai University, told the Global Times that removal of the COVID-19 control barriers will certainly be conducive to Hong Kong's economic recovery and help the city regain its status as a shining world financial center and a bridge connecting the mainland and the world.

In the subsequent 10 years, the Wing Loong family has developed fast with multiple models, wide operational applications and strong task capability. The drones have been widely used in the military and civilian fields, and have been sold around the world.The Global Times learned on Tuesday from Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), the manufacturer of the Wing Long family, that the Wing Loong 1E UAV, which debuted in Zhuhai for the first time in the form of a real aircraft, is a next-generation, medium- to long-endurance armed reconnaissance UAV system developed on the basis of the Wing Loong 1. Wing Loong 1E made its maiden flight earlier this year.The Wing Loong 1E has a long range and flight duration, high altitude takeoff and landing features, and strong adaptability to complex environmental conditions. It can carry different loads according to the characteristics of the mission, so as to achieve the purpose of ""multiple uses of one drone."" The aircraft will be able to carry out continuous intelligence reconnaissance and surveillance over land and sea, take part in combat air patrols and close air support, provide guided weapons with mid-range guidance and target guidance, support precision fire strikes and fixed point clearance, carry out damage assessment and other missions, and offer good mission expansion capability, said the company. Tang Yong, chief designer of the Wing Loong-1E, told the Global Times that in flight control, the Wing Loong 1E can collect the same signal with three sensors at the same time, and calculate the same instruction by three computers at the same time to ensure the correct control decisions and instructions. At the same time, it can deal with tens of thousands of fault modes under emergency conditions. Even if it stops in the air, it can also automatically plan a route and realize a non-powered crash landing. In the aspect of linking and navigation, all kinds of interference and hijacking scenarios have been fully considered and automatically dealt with.With a maximum endurance of 45 hours and a maximum range of 7,000 kilometers, the Wing-Loong 1E can fly at an altitude of 10,000 meters while carrying two 50kg-class weapons, giving it a strong takeoff and landing performance. Even at a high-altitude airport of 4,000 meters above sea level, the Wing-Loong 1E can take off and land normally under the maximum weight condition of the external configuration. Taking off and landing at the maximum weight of a low-altitude airport requires only a few hundred meters, Tang said. The Wing-Loong 1E is also equipped with high-performance photoelectric sensors and multifunctional radar. Besides conventional photoelectric and radar detection, it is also capable of digital photography, geo-positioning and meteorological detection, according to Tang.With the development of technology, Wing Loong series UAVs continue to evolve. According to Tang, in the Wing Loong 1E UAVs, technologies such as photoelectric/radar sensing coordination, attack and flight coordination, navigation and anti-deception, attack route planning, and virtual sensors have all become ""standard features"" of the platform. At the same time, the ground station's intelligence data fusion, autonomous task planning, intelligent target identification and other capabilities have also greatly improved the intelligence level of the system. Apart from the Wing Loong 1E, as the star of the Wing Loong family at the Airshow, the Wing Loong 3 is a long-range, heavy-duty, multi-tasking, medium-long endurance UAV system developed by the AVIC on the basis of the Wing Loong series of UAV systems. It is the latest member of the Wing Loong family.According to the company, the Wing Loong 3's UAV system consists of the UAV platform, mission payload, ground control station and integrated support system. The Wing Loong 3's UAV system has fully autonomous takeoff, landing and cruise flight capabilities, air-to-ground coordination capabilities, and ground relay control capabilities. Equipped with visible light, infrared light, radar, communication signals and other reconnaissance loads, it has the capabilities of all-area reconnaissance, intelligent fusion processing, accurate reconnaissance, identification and positioning.The Wing Loong 3 can perform a full field reconnaissance and cross-domain support collaboration. The drone can also be used for anti-submarine warfare, anti-radiation, low-altitude alert and interception, electronic reconnaissance and interference, communications relay, and maritime rescue missions.Other members of the Wing Loong family such as the Wing Loong 2D, Wing Loong 2Y and Wing Loong 2H also debuted in the form of models for the first time at the air show.

Many gathered as closely as they can to take pictures of the J-20s or have their photos taken with the J-20s, as this was their first opportunity to do so.""Thrilling, satisfying"" are some of the words many spectators told the Global Times describing the event. When the J-20 performed its first landing at the show, many viewers shouted, ""It is coming! It is like we are about to celebrate the Chinese lunar spring festival. Bravo! The Chinese PLA Air Force!""One of the last moves in the J-20s' performance was a rolling while ascending, with the aircraft's nose kept changing the direction it was pointing to. This shows that the J-20 has excellent mobility and very flexible aim, which can give it advantages in air combat, Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday at the airshow site.The J-20 can perform supersonic cruise and has subsonic super maneuverability at the same time. This is realized thanks to the J-20's unique aerodynamic design of lifting body with strakes and canards, plus domestically developed engines, Zhang said.A four-aircraft formation of the J-20 is a large tactical unit with high combat-oriented significance, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The J-20's first static display at the airshow displayed China's confidence in the aircraft, reflecting that many warplanes of this type are already in service and have formed complete combat and logistics support capabilities, and that this advanced stealth fighter is no longer ""mysterious,"" Song said.Besides the J-20, the YU-20 aerial tanker also delivered its first flight performance to the public, as it released all three of its aerial refueling baskets, showing its capabilities to host aerial refueling for two small aircraft simultaneously or for a large aircraft.The J-16 heavy fighter jet was another main combat aircraft of the PLA Air Force that performed at the airshow. The J-16 released flares while performing a combat roll, as the beautiful move led many on the ground to express admiration.The PLA Army for the first time sent the Z-20 utility helicopter, the Z-10 attack helicopter and the Z-8L transport helicopter to conduct flight performances at the Airshow China.Other equipment like drones also attracted attention.""This is the third Airshow China I have visited. This year, I was looking forward to seeing new aircraft like the H-20 bomber or the J-35 fighter jet. Now that they did not come, what I'm interested next is drone development,"" Atsushi Okudera, chief of Japanese newspaper The Asahi Shimbun's Guangzhou/Hong Kong bureau, told the Global Times at the airshow on Tuesday. Many of the aircraft on display at the airshow, including the J-20, the J-16 and the YU-20, participated in a large-scale military exercises around Taiwan island in August following US house speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island that seriously violated China's sovereignty.Other first-time exhibits, including the KJ-500A early warning aircraft with in-flight-refuel capability, a JH-7A2 fighter bomber carrying what seems to be a stealth air-to-surface cruise missile and an H-6K bomber carrying two what seems to be air-launched ballistic missiles that analysts said can target aircraft carriers, can also play vital roles over the Taiwan question, observers said.The PLA Army's Z-20 utility helicopter, the Z-10 attack helicopter and the Z-8L transport helicopter are also a perfect combination in a potential horizontal landing mission when operated from a Type 075 amphibious assault ship of the PLA Navy, as the Z-20 will lead the assault under the escort of the Z-10, followed by the Z-8L, analysts said.These weapons and equipment are not aimed at Taiwan compatriots, but ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and external interference forces, Song said.If it comes to that, the PLA will use the best weapons and equipment there are to counter Taiwan secessionists and end a potential military conflict with the smallest cost; it is also important to show external forces like the US what the PLA is capable of, Song said. ""The PLA will put the moves, performances and capabilities displayed at the airshow into practice,"" he said.Both new missiles carried by the H-6K bomber and the JH-7A2 fighter bomber are stand-off weapons that can contribute to the PLA's potential anti-access and area denial missions against external military interference, Song pointed out.With the YU-20 aerial tanker that can extend the range and endurance of fighter jets, bombers and early warning aircraft, the PLA Air Force can more easily break the first island chain created by the US in an attempt to contain China, analysts said.The PLA's main combat aircraft, including the J-10C fighter, the J-15 carrier-based fighter, the J-16 heavy fighter, the J-20 stealth fighter, the KJ-500A early warning aircraft and the H-6N long range strategic bomber, are capable of receiving aerial refueling, according to media reports.                            "

The service ceiling is 15 kilometers, while the original one was 10-13 kilometers. ""In short, the new type of CH-7 is able to fly higher and stay longer in the mission zone, to be more focused on round-the-clock reconnaissance and monitoring in highly dangerous environments, and able to keep detecting hostile targets for a longer time. It's also able to carry large missiles or guide other weapons to strike enemy targets with high values,"" Shi said.It's also able to effectively shorten an enemy radar's detection range and keep containing the enemy's anti-air firepower, and greatly improve the effectiveness in information-based combat, to meet the demand for high-end UAVs in the future symmetric warfare, Shi noted. Apart from the high-end UAV CH-7, Caihong also made improvements in its mature middle-end product CH-5, which has been exported to many countries and seen plenty of use in actual combat. According to the official introduction, the CH-5 has a wingspan of 21 meters, a service ceiling of 8,300 meters and a maximum takeoff weight of 3.3 tons. It serves the coastal area and border regions by carrying out round-the-clock reconnaissance and monitoring, accurate positioning of targets, frontier and coast defense patrols, striking and damage effect evaluation, and strikes on time-sensitive targets.This time, Caihong displayed a CH-5 for marine service, and Shi said this type of CH-5 was developed for missions with complicated sea conditions. According to the publicity video released by Caihong at the exhibition hall, the CH-5 for maritime mission can drop sonobuoys into the sea.Military analysts said sonobuoys are key for searching for submarines under the sea. The US Navy has used US-made MQ-9Bs to test using UAVs for anti-submarine missions in recent years. Compared with anti-submarine aircraft like the P-8A, the drone can carry fewer sonobuoys, but it can carry out round-the-clock reconnaissance and monitoring for days, so most conventionally powered submarines will find it hard to escape detection. The CH-5 for marine service has four pods for carrying sonobuoys, so it can also conduct similar anti-submarine missions like the MQ-9B of the US. With joint operations with anti-submarine aircraft and vessels, it could become a ""submarine hunter"" with advanced capability, said experts. Apart from military uses, Caihong's UAVs are also involved in civilian services. According to the official introduction, Caihong worked with the Geology Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Land and Resources to develop the first Caihong UAV aeromagnetic and airborne radioactive application system in China.It completed a global first with large-scale aeromagnetic and radioactive integrated operations in Zambia. So far, the system has completed 460,000 kilometers of range in China and abroad and 300,000 kilometers of valid pipeline measuring assignments.For public security, the Caihong UAVs are able to secure on-the-spot information in disasters, and they have participated in disaster relief after earthquake. For urban security, the drones can conduct anti-terrorism missions, reconnaissance patrols, territory security protection and other relevant missions.                           "

It can form a dense formation and efficiently coordinate with manned combat aircraft to perform air superiority operations, air defense suppression, and air escort missions, the Global Times learned from the drone's developers.It can solve not only the problems of limited service scale of manned aircraft and aging aircraft, but also build a pattern of unmanned cooperative combat.The FH-97A can carry out collaborative reconnaissance with special mission aircraft, as it can detect potential threats and provide early warning by flying ahead of the manned aircraft, or it can also extend the reconnaissance time and scope taking advantage of its long endurance and range.When cooperating with a fighter jet, the FH-97A can carry out air defense suppression by carrying electronic reconnaissance and jamming payloads and conduct close-in reconnaissance and interference tasks, which can allow the fighter to penetrate the enemy defense and also constantly paralyze the enemy's air defense system.In another scenario working together with a fighter jet, the FH-97A can carry reconnaissance payloads and fly ahead of the flight formation to make contact with the enemy first, provide fire control guidance data to the fighter, allowing the latter to fire faster than the enemy.""The FH-97A is not only a sensor, but also an ammunition depot, and also an intelligent assistant for pilots. It can extend a pilot's situational awareness and scope of attack, and by using FH-97As in large numbers, each loyal wingman drone can become an intelligent node in the air combat system, obtain local combat information, and filter and integrate to form a wider battlefield situation, assist pilots to make decisions, and liberate people from dangerous and highly tense combat environments, so that in addition to being traditional pilots, the pilots can become more of commanders of a flight formation."" Deng said.In Airshow China 2021, Feihong company exhibited a new generation of high-speed stealth multi-purpose UAV system called FH-97, which adopts a stealth design and can quickly reach combat zones within a radius of 1,000 kilometers. It can conduct all-day, all-weather, and all-territory battlefield situational awareness missions for more than 6 hours, and is equipped with intelligent and smart ammunition. The FH-97A loyal wingman at Airshow China 2022 has undergone major changes and upgrades on the basis of the FH-97 in appearance and function.Deng said that the FH-97A has changed compared with the FH-97 in terms of the electro-optical payload and the air intake method. ""The electro-optical payload of the FH-97 is under the fuselage, while the electro-optical payload of the FH-97A is above the fuselage. The FH-97 uses an intake on the back, while the FH-97A has side intakes. In addition, there are some differences in the weapons bay, as the new FH-97A's weapons bay is designed to enhance the maneuverability and speed in air combat while the FH-97's weapons bay is designed for land attack.""The weapons bay of the FH-97A can carry eight smaller, intelligent air-to-air missiles. The drone can also carry pods with different functions, including radar jamming, reconnaissance and communications jamming, as well as fuel tanks, extra missiles and precision guided weapons.Thanks to the embedded intelligent skin antenna, the loyal wingman drone is also difficult to jam. The UAV's low observation design and intelligent evade capability plus infrared flares and chaff jamming equipment give it a good survivability, Deng said,The FH-97A is equipped with two engines, and Deng said this design can improve the flight speed and maneuverability of this type of UAV on the one hand, and on the other hand it improves the reliability. ""If one engine fails, the other one can also ensure that the UAV can complete the task.""In addition to conventional wheeled take-off and landing on runways, this type of UAV can also use rocket booster for complete take-off and landing under special conditions, and carry out arrested recovery. Deng said that the FH-97A could be reconfigured and become operable on vessels. The development team has reserved spaces for strengthened landing gear and strengthened tail hook among others, as maritime deployment was considered at the very beginning of the development, he said.Although the FH-97A has excellent endurance and can accompany manned aircraft throughout the entire flight, aerial refueling is still a future development direction of this type of UAV. ""In the future, the FH-97A will definitely have the capability to receive aerial refueling."" Deng said.In addition, as a loyal wingman that can accompany different aircraft, the FH-97A also needs to establish contact with different models of fighters. Its airborne data link system has a multi-band format, which is compatible with various aircraft in active service and can realize cross-platform interconnection.""This loyal wingman can build a data link system with different aircraft, and can establish the internal networking of the drone formation and the collaborative networking with manned aircraft. In addition, thanks to the compatibility of the system, there is no need for additional installations and modifications to manned aircraft,"" Deng said.                          "

It's about 10 meters high, and it attracted wide attention not only from military enthusiasts but also from foreign visitors.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-10/2bf235dd-e130-4afe-ac4f-898480b06fd0.jpeg," China's leading radar developer exhibited a giant space monitoring radar, which is believed to be the ""most powerful radar,"" at this year's Airshow China. It's about 10 meters high, and it attracted wide attention not only from military enthusiasts but also from foreign visitors.Standing out in the pavilion and recognizable for its huge and spectacular array of antennas, the SLC-18 space surveillance active phased array radar, developed by the No.14 Research Institute of CETC (China Electronics Technology Group Corp), was exhibited for the first time. With the development of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellite technology, satellites mainly used for information collection and battlefield reconnaissance have gradually become core equipment for modern, powerful countries to obtain remote information.These satellites are usually characterized by strong capability, small size and flexible orbits, and they can realize intensive, 360-degree and all-factor reconnaissance of hot spots. The Global Times learned from the No.14 Research Institute that the radar can search, track, calculate, catalog and forecast space targets such as LEO satellites, and obtain multi-target tracking and measurement data. It is mainly used for space target monitoring.Sun Lei, deputy general manager of CETE Guorui Group, told the Global Times that in order to guard against the prying eyes of other countries' satellites, movements of sensitive equipment or deployments on the ground of many countries must often maneuver intentionally to avoid the transit time of satellites, or take countermeasures to interfere with satellite signals. All of this is based on knowing when a satellite is in transit, but for most developing countries, it is difficult and expensive to develop the technology to monitor space targets. In the past, they bought in-orbit satellite data from developed countries, which is expensive and often outdated, making it difficult to obtain first-hand information, Sun said. According to Sun, the SLC-18 radar, a P-band solid-state active phased array radar, is mainly used for space target monitoring. It can search for and capture LEO satellites and other space targets, and obtain multi-target tracking and measurement data.In recent years, the US has promoted constellations of LEO reconnaissance satellites. They are no longer a few expensive satellites, but often consist of hundreds of small satellites. For example, the NDSA ""Defense Space Architecture Layered Orbit Satellite Constellation"" proposed by the Pentagon includes a large number of satellites running in different orbits. The US military plans to launch as many as 100 satellites in the next five years. To cope with new challenges posed by constant launches of LEO satellites, the space monitoring system must have the ability to quickly monitor and identify objects, which brings new technical challenges.""The SLC-18 radar can detect satellites from afar, and identify and catalog satellites to form a radar database, so as to guide other equipment to respond accordingly. It can also send satellite data to the command center to help make decisions,"" Sun told the Global Times. The SLC-18 has wide-area detection capability, which can quickly capture a satellite's orbit and input the orbital data into the database. Through comparative analysis, it can quickly determine whether it is a new type of satellite and what its main use is, according to the orbit characteristics. The radar has such outstanding advantages as all-weather, all-time, multi-target, large power and large search areas, which can detect LEO targets in a wide range of airspace and cover a large number of LEO satellite targets, he noted. The Global Times learned from the institute that the SLC-18 radar can complete the all-round monitoring of satellite targets, and it has the ability to survey space targets. It also has a high measurement accuracy. Based on the tracking information of the radar, a satellite overhead transit forecast can be provided through the orbit determination, and offer enough time for on-the-ground decision-making to take countermeasures.Sun said that the radar is domestically made from manufacturing to chip technology and at the same time, it adopts the modular design, which means the radar can further improve its ability based on the need to increase the module, indicating that China's radar development has reached a new level.""In the past, only a strong military power that had technical strength and economic and industrial foundations could conduct space target surveillance. For developing countries, it was difficult to have such capability. ""The SLC-18 radar uses relatively cost-effective ground-based space target surveillance, and it can serve countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, and provide situational awareness against LEO satellites,"" Sun said.                          "

The corporation displayed the VT-4A1 type main battle tanks for the first time at the Airshow. The model has been upgraded from the VT-4, a main battle tank that enjoys a high reputation at home and abroad. By upgrading the active protection system and the vehicle drones' situational awareness system, it can also perform coordinated combat with small unmanned vehicles.  Cheng said heavy assault forces, represented by tanks and armored vehicles, will still be the main force in the future frontal battlefield, but they will need to undergo information and intelligent transformation and strengthen battlefield situational awareness to adapt to new challenges.To cope with the threat of advanced over-the-top attack munitions, the VT-4A1 is equipped with a high-precision millimeter-wave radar around the turret, which can detect incoming missiles and guide the active protection system to detonate incoming missiles from opponents, improving the tank's protection capability.The VT-5U light tank in the tank battalion is also an unmanned transformation on the basis of the previous VT-5 light tank. It is equipped with a vehicle-mounted UAV, which can take off from the tank independently, ensuring the tank's aerial vision and enhancing its battlefield situational awareness. The VT-5U also has the capability of ""manned-unmanned conversion,"" which means that in high-risk combat situations, VT-5U crews can get out of the vehicle if necessary and fight with a remotely controlled tank, turning the king of land warfare into an unmanned combat vehicle.Cheng revealed that the next development direction of China's main battle tank, in addition to improving the three traditional performance indicators of mobility, protection and firepower, will focus on enhancing situational awareness and information capabilities.Also making its debut was the VN-20 tracked heavy infantry fighting vehicle. It has the same power cabin as the VT-4, but it is bulkier than the VT-4Al. ""It is because the VN-20 adds anti-mine components and more reactive armor around the hull of the VN-20, so that it has a strong protection level to maximize the safety of the infantry in the vehicle,"" Cheng said, noting that the current VN-20 protection capability has reached the world's advanced level.In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Russian army used large-caliber artillery bombardment and the Ukrainian army carried out ""guerrilla artillery warfare"" with the help of self-propelled howitzers provided by the West, which all show that artillery is still the ""king of war"" in modern large-scale ground combat, which determines the outcome of the battlefield.Cheng said the artillery battalion's role was to deliver fire power. ""Tanks and armored vehicles are mainly engaged in head-to-head confrontation, but to strike an opponent's effective force, it still needs artillery battalions to achieve it.""The artillery battalion is mainly composed of 155mm howitzers and long-range rocket launchers, which offer range integration, point-to-point combination, multiple damage and precision strikes. The former includes traditional towed howitzers, the wheeled guns that can travel at high speeds in flat areas, and tracked self-propelled howitzers that can cross field environments such as flat ground. The corresponding combat equipment can be selected according to the needs of users in different combat environments.A drone battalion also appeared in the army brigade combat team for the first time, which Cheng said showed that the rapid development of drone technology and equipment has enabled various types of drones to play important roles in certain situations.The army brigade combat team is a new system model that all military powers in the world are focusing on. Providing such a solution shows China's ability to construct systemic equipment, to develop military communications technology, to instruct information for joint operations and to integrate multi-equipment modular systems, the expert stressed.

However, work for combat readiness does not mean to be belligerent, as the way to ensure that there is no war is to have the strength to win a war.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, chairman of the CMC, and commander-in-chief of the CMC joint operations command center, met with representatives of officers and soldiers of the command center and conveyed sincere greetings to all of its members, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Xi said that as the world is undergoing more profound changes unseen in a century, China's national security is facing increased instability and uncertainty, and its military tasks remain arduous.He demanded that the entire armed forces implement the Party's thinking on strengthening the military for the new era, follow the military strategy for the new era and adhere to combat effectiveness as the sole criterion.Xi also instructed them to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, and successfully complete various tasks entrusted by the Party and the people.The command center, which provides vital support to the strategic command of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC, is of great importance and shoulders heavy responsibilities, Xi said. He noted that the center should make new and greater contributions to boosting military training and combat preparedness, effectively fulfilling all missions and tasks in the new eraThe CMC joint operations command center was established in 2016 to partially replace the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department. As the highest operational command of the Chinese armed forces, the command center is responsible for directing the joint operations of all the armed forces.Reports and public documents show that Xi visited the command center for the first time on April 20, 2016, and again in 2017. Military strength, combat preparedness and national security were all mentioned during his three inspections.The form of joint operations will be the mainstream in future military conflicts, so it is necessary to strengthen the cohesion and seamless connection of all arms and services to form a strong combat effectiveness, Chinese military expert Song Zhongping told the Global Times on Wednesday. Echoing Song, Beijing-based military expert Li Jie said that the Russia-Ukraine conflict shows the importance of building a complete combat system and joint command. ""It is necessary to lay a solid foundation for military preparedness in all areas of land, sea, air and space.""Experts believed that the greatest security threats are from the US, which targets China as ""most consequential geopolitical challenge"" in the Biden administration's first formal national security strategy released October, with the result of the midterm elections possibly leading to a tougher China policy.The US threat is growing in both traditional and non-traditional security fields, and no matter whether it is in the Taiwan Straits or the South China Sea, the US is no longer hiding its efforts to step up provocations that directly target China, Song said. When it comes to some Western media's hype over the alleged ""China threat"" on military development, experts stressed that China's military development is to protect its own interests from hegemonism.""Working for combat readiness does not mean being belligerent,"" Li said. ""All countries prepare for the situation in their neighborhood, and China is no exception, especially in today's increasingly tense situation.""""The only way to ensure that there is no war is to have the strength to win a war,"" Song said.When the US hegemony continues to bully, provoke and even split China, only through strength can we safeguard national security and regional peace and stability, Song said. As it says in President Xi's report on the 20th National Congress of the CPC, the Chinese mainland will continue to strive for peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and the utmost effort, but will never promise to renounce the use of force, and we reserve the option of taking all necessary measures, Song said.                          "

This is expected to comprehensively enhance the aircraft's survivability and combat capabilities, and it has realized the complete independent support of domestically developed engines.The five Taihang engines are used on different aircraft, according to AECC.One of the five Taihang engines on display has a 2D thrust vectoring control nozzle, which attracted attention from visitors.Thrust vectoring control can greatly enhance the maneuverability of an aircraft, usually a fighter jet, by providing thrust directly to a desired direction in addition to using aerodynamics, and this will give the aircraft many tactical advantages in combat, Wei Dongxu, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times at the Airshow China site.An aero engine with a thrust vectoring control nozzle is mechanically and structurally more complex than an engine without one, and this means that thrust vectoring control usually causes a certain level of thrust loss. A 2D nozzle could lose even more thrust than a 3D nozzle. China's development of a turbofan engine with a 2D thrust vectoring control nozzle means the engine has sufficient power that it can manage the loss of some thrust, Wei said.A 2D nozzle usually has better radar and infrared stealth capability than a 3D nozzle, and that makes the 2D nozzle a generally better option, if the engine itself can provide enough power, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times.Li Gang, the pilot of the J-20 stealth fighter jet's first flight, said in a media interview in 2021 that he would like to see the J-20 be upgraded with engines with 2D thrust vectoring nozzles.At Airshow China 2018, a J-10B thrust vector control demonstrator equipped with an engine with 3D thrust vectoring control nozzle delivered a flight performance. An engine with a 3D thrust vectoring control nozzle was also on display this year as one of the five Taihang variants.AECC also displayed for the first time the AEF1300, a turbofan engine with high thrust, high bypass ratio and low fuel consumption. It is expected to meet the demands of China's large aircraft.As drones are coming to play some main roles in modern warfare, AECC also put a type of low-cost turbojet engine on display. As future warfare may require high-speed swarm drones and target drones, this engine's production cost is lower than 100,000 yuan ($13,800).                         "

This will meet the demands from Chinese and foreign users for ""cross regional long range flight and extended mission,"" the drone designer said.The drone is characterized by its long range, heavy payload and multirole capabilities. Major performance criteria of the Wing Loong 3, including its range, endurance and cruise altitude, are of top tiers around the world, Zhou said.The Wing Loong 3 on display at the airshow carried many different types of payloads, including  anti-radiation missiles, guided glide bombs, sonobuoy pods, cluster bombs, communications reconnaissance pod, guided rockets, sonar reconnaissance pods, loitering munitions and even air-to-air missiles like the PL-10E, making it a drone capable of air-to-air combat. It can also carry optical, infrared, radar and communications signal reconnaissance payloads.Zhou said that the Wing Loong 3 can carry payloads under its wings, under its fuselage and within its fuselage. The payload weight and number of hardpoints of the drone are all world-leading top class, he said.With so many different types of payloads being displayed at the airshow, the Wing Loong 3 exhibited its multirole capabilities that can meet different demands from Chinese and foreign users, Zhou said.It can carry out military and civilian missions including cross regional armed reconnaissance, cooperative support, combat under confrontational environments and emergency rescue, analysts said.With all development procedures going according to plan, the Wing Loong 3 is expected to conduct its first flight soon and achieve operational capability as fast as possible, Zhou told the Global Times.The Wing Loong 3 will also spawn variants to meet different user demands, Zhou said.With payload expansions, the aircraft can conduct maritime escort, anti-submarine, aerial fire support, anti-radiation attack, low altitude alert patrol and interception, electronic reconnaissance and disruption, communications relay as well as maritime search and rescue missions, and it can even team up with manned aircraft and other drones, analysts said.The maker of the drone, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, also displayed other members in the Wing Loong drone family at Airshow China 2022, including the smaller Wing Loong 1E, the Wing Loong 2D, the Wing Loong 2Y and the Wing Loong 2H, as well as the faster Wing Loong 10A and the Wing Loong 10B.

Dubbed the killer of UAVs, the weapon can launch effective strikes on low, slow and small (LSS) targets, which refer to those that fly below an altitude of one kilometer, at speeds of around 200 kilometers per hour and have a radar cross-section smaller than one square meter.The weapon also reminded many military fans of a similar weapon that Saudi Arabia announced at the first Arab World Defense Exhibition on March 6 it had purchased from China: the ""Silent Hunter"" laser air defense system.The vehicle-based laser weapon, called the LW-30 laser defense weapon system, was unveiled by the China Space Sanjiang Group under the China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), one of China's largest missile manufacturers.Laser defense weapons are a new type of weapon that use high-energy laser beams to attack targets. Its characteristics in-clude ""light speed engagement, silent attack, continuous operation, flexible and accurate, high cost-effectiveness ratio."" It is a new type of weapon that all military powers are focusing on developing, and has broad application prospects in the international military trade market. By focusing high-energy laser on one point, when the energy reaches a certain level, the targeted weapon can directly burn through the control panel of the UAV.""The LW-30 laser defense weapon system has a power output of 30kw. The laser comes out of the canister of the tracking and firing system and hits the target directly, knocking it out,"" Chen Chaoyang, spokesman for China Space Sanjiang Group, told the Global Times. ""The system is effective at intercepting targets within a few kilometers. Achieving instantaneous destruction of the UAV requires a higher-power output from the system, and the weapon system is still being optimized for this purpose,"" Chen said. The Global Times learned from the company that the LW-30 laser defense weapon system is mainly used for critical field air defense, with hard killing capability against typical targets such as UAVs, as well as hard and soft killing capability against photoelectric detection and guidance equipment. Compared with other air defense equipment, this weapon has high strike efficiency, multi-target strike capability, which can fire multiple times in a short time with high strike accuracy, and strong sustained operation. The implementation of electric energy strikes also makes the weapon cheap to use - just a dozen yuan (about $2). It can also respond quickly as it only takes a few seconds for the system to aim at the target.This system can be flexibly deployed in key areas according to specific scenarios and needs. It can carry out not only independent combat with a single vehicle, but also multi-vehicle network attacks. It can also be incorporated into traditional air defense weapon systems, and be used with traditional weapons such as close-in artillery and air de-fense missiles.It is widely believed that the laser needs to be active at one point for a sustained period of time to damage the target, which raises the question of how the LW-30 achieves multiple target strikes and multiple shots in a short period of time. Chen told the Global Times that the laser vehicle can inflict damage on ordinary targets for a few seconds. That is to say, within the range of the target, the weapon can shoot down a drone in a few seconds, and then enters into another drone attack mode. The vehicle's tracking and sighting system can rotate 360 degrees to instantly turn fire on another drone.In addition to high strike efficiency, compared with traditional anti-aircraft weapons, laser weapons are cheaper to use because they mainly rely on electricity converted into laser to destroy targets. ""If it's an ordinary small drone, it costs about a dozen yu-an, and our goal is to try to bring the cost down even further,"" Chen said.The widespread use of UAVs in hot military conflicts has also led to an increasing demand for anti-UAVs. In terms of defense systems, the laser weapon is a hot new weapon, and all countries are spending a lot of money researching and producing this kind of weapon. As drones continue to improve, laser weapons continue to be upgraded. ""The LW-30 laser defense system is mainly aimed at low, small and slow UAVs and has a very good defensive effect. The global market prospects are very broad,"" Chen said.                         "

The container is about 13 meters long, 2.3 meters wide and 2.5 meters high.The Global Times learned from the corporation that the missile launch system can integrate an operating station, a power station and missile launchers into the container.A representative from the No.3 Research Institute under CASIC told the Global Times at the airshow that the missile launch system, no matter what platform it is mounted on, does not need an external power source. Its own power supply can fully meet the operational needs.""The launch system can connect with various independent detection and command units such as early warning aircraft, maritime patrol aircraft and shore-based radars. It could receive target information from those external sources through encrypted data,"" he said.According to the representative, based on the information from the detection unit, the command unit could formulate a combat plan automatically. The command unit then sends the instructions to the launch system. The detection unit and command unit can also provide operational information support for the launch system. After making some adjustments, the operators then confirm the plan and send the order to each station as well as the firing parameters to each launch unit.""The launch system does not require a lot of personnel. It only takes four people to complete the whole launch process,"" the representative said.The Global Times reporters noted that the launch system on display adopts a quadruple mounting method, which can simultaneously carry four YJ-12E supersonic anti-ship missiles. In addition, the launch system can optionally be equipped with four YJ-18E anti-ship missiles, as well as other types of anti-ship missile weapon systems, reflecting its strong compatibility. Among them, the YJ-12E supersonic anti-ship missile can reach Mach 3 and has a range of 290 kilometers. Compared with the usual subsonic anti-ship missile, YJ-12E has an advanced flight speed and strong penetration ability, which makes it an effective weapon to break through hostile missile defense system.Meanwhile, it has the advantages of high accuracy, outstanding damage output and low life cycle cost. It is mainly used to attack large and medium-sized surface vessels and high-value targets on the ground. This standoff weapon is highly disguisable, could operate actively and respond in a short time. It is a powerful weapon to achieve long-range, rapid and precise attack on high-value targets.The YJ-18E anti-ship missile adopts a system of ""subsonic cruise plus supersonic strike,"" taking into account the unique advantages of long range during subsonic flight and final supersonic attack. The missile can covertly strike large and medium-sized surface vessels and formations at a long distance, and at the same time has the ability to attack small ships and fixed targets on land.The missile is designed for hidden attacks, can travel long distances, has high damage output and is easy to use. It has a maximum range of nearly 300 kilometers, leading the international market. Using advanced flight altitude control technology, it can fly close to the sea at ultra-low altitude, and choose the appropriate attack route and attack mode according to the specific battle scenario.The terminal stage of the missile can effectively break through enemy defenses. The missile's seeker has a variety of guidance modes and is capable of precision strikes against multiple targets at sea and on land through modular retooling. A single hit can heavily damage or sink a typical ship target.According to a CAISC representative, the container-type sea defense combat system can be mixed with the YJ-12E supersonic anti-ship missile and YJ-18E anti-ship missile or other types of anti-ship missile. However, to achieve the best strike effect, the most ideal way is to simultaneously deploy YJ-12E supersonic anti-ship missile and YJ-18E anti-ship missile.""The container-type launch system can change its firing angle at will, or even launch the missile vertically,"" the representative said.The Global Times learned from the corporation that the missile launch system can be loaded on heavy trucks, becoming a set of maneuverable shore-to-ship missile launching system. It can also be used in the upgrades of old warships.""This weapon system, if deployed ashore, will effectively enhance a country's defense capability to safeguard its exclusive economic zone,"" the Global Times was told.

The smaller size allows a single transporter erector launcher to carry more of them, Wei Dongxu, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times at the airshow site. The larger missiles will be used to intercept targets farther away, and if remaining targets come closer, the smaller missiles can be used, Wei said. This will enhance the HQ-9B's capability to deal with saturation attacks, he said.Independently developed by China, the HQ-9B is a mid- to long-range surface-to-air missile weapon system of a new generation used to intercept cluster assaults and aerial weapons under strong electromagnetic interference, the Global Times learned at the airshow.As China's backbone equipment in homeland air defense and anti-missile combat, it can cover a large area with dense firepower and good anti-jamming capabilities.The HQ-9B is also available for export under the name of HQ-9BE, which was also displayed at the Airshow China 2022.Another new air defense system, the HQ-11 universal terminal defense system, made its debut at the airshow. It consists of a vehicle equipped with eight missile vertical launch cells and another vehicle equipped with a close-in gun. Both vehicles are equipped with corresponding radar systems.Wei said that the HQ-11 is designed to cover a shorter range than the HQ-9B, but it is very fast and mobile so that it can accompany valuable assets on the move. It is like putting a vessel-based air defense system onto the land.The Global Times learned that another highlight of the HQ-11 is its universality, as it can be used not only by the PLA Air Force, but also the Army and the Navy. It can intercept air-to-surface missiles, guided bombs, cruise missiles and other aerial weapons like fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters.China also for the first time unveiled its fourth-generation advanced air defense equipment, the HQ-16FE mid- to long-range air defense missile weapon system. Developed by the Eighth Academy of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, the system's transporter erector launcher can carry six missiles at a time.The HQ-16FE can intercept multiple types of targets including manned aircraft, drones, cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles in a very intelligent and aggressive manner.Compared with its predecessors, the HQ-16FE has a longer range and a stronger anti-deception capability, the Global Times learned from its maker.Together with the air defense missiles, a type of vehicle-mounted tactical laser weapon of the PLA Air Force also made its debut at the airshow. It is a new type of combat force that targets low, slow, small targets like drones.It engages targets at the speed of light, is highly precise, can control its damage output, has low operational cost and can conduct missions extensively.

During the roll, the aircraft's nose kept changing the direction it was pointing to, drawing a circle with the axis of the flight path in its center, instead of the usual rolls shown by other aircraft, during which the nose would travel along the axis without changing direction.The J-20 performed this maneuver not only when flying forward, but also when climbing.This, together with some small-radius turns and climbs, displayed the J-20's outstanding maneuverability and its ability to point its nose at a target during a maneuver. These moves will win the J-20 advantages in air combat, Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese military expert, told the Global Times after watching the J-20's performances.This is realized through the unique aerodynamic design, which is an independent innovation of China, as well as China's domestically built engines, Zhang said.It is expected that the J-20 will enhance its maneuverability with new engines with thrust vectoring control. Taihang series turbofan engines with  were also on display at the Airshow China 2022.Four J-20s flew in a diamond formation during the flight performances, and this is a large tactical unit with high combat-oriented significance, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.Another highlight of the J-20s' display at this year's air show was their landings and takeoffs in front of the general public for the first time. When landing, the J-20s released drag parachutes, and when taking off, two J-20s lifted off at the same time.Photographers who have seen landings and takeoffs of other warplanes told the Global Times at the air show site that the runway distance required for the J-20 to take off and land is very short.This is of tactical significance because in combat, a runway could be targeted and damaged, and using only a small portion of undamaged runway to take off and land can greatly increase the warplane's operational capability. At the same time it could reduce the risk of getting hit during the process, analysts said.During the static display after the landing of the J-20s, observers noted that there were what seemed to be construction numbers painted on the aircraft. Based on these numbers, US media outlet Defense News speculated that China has likely built more than 200 J-20s.If this is the case, the number of J-20s has surpassed that of the F-22, the J-20's US counterpart. Some 186 F-22s were delivered to the US Air Force.All these details reflected achievements by the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Air Force and the country's aviation industry, and they will serve as deterrents to potential opponents including ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists and external interference forces, showing that the PLA is fully capable of safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, experts said.

The three-hour meeting was in-depth, candid and constructive, the two leaders said, and they instructed the teams from the two countries to follow up on the key consensuses reached by the two leaders and take concrete actions to push China-US relations back to a stable track, China Central Television reported. In Biden's briefing on Monday, he said that National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan as well as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would ""be engaging with their counterparts from China,"" South China Morning Post reported. US media outlets, like CNN and the Wall Street Journal, have expressed a positive tone over the meeting, believing that China and the US are moving toward reopening more channels of communications and exchanges, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is ""expected to visit China next year.""Echoing the recent media reports, Chinese experts said head-of-state diplomacy provided authorization for the resumption and promotion of dialogue at all levels. For the US, the need to revive military-to-military dialogue is even more pressing.Zhou Bo, an expert from the Center for International Security and Strategy, Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the military communication and dialogue between the two countries have always been in a position of urgent need. On August 5, China announced eight countermeasures in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's highly provocative visit to China's Taiwan region in August, where she met with secessionists. These included canceling China-US theater commanders talk, defense policy coordination talks, and military maritime security consultative mechanism, and suspending cooperation on illegal immigration repatriation, drug control and climate change.During the phone call with Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on October 30, Blinken said it is necessary to keep communication channels open and responsibly manage competition. Austin said in October that his department was working to reopen channels of military communication with China, according to media reports. Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US dares not underestimate the strength of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the exercises held in August after Pelosi's visit fully demonstrated China's determination and capability to resolve the Taiwan question.""If the US continues to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's sovereignty and security interests, China does not need to have any communication with the US military and will act in the way it deems best,"" Lü said. Experts believe that given the escalating tensions between the two countries, the resumption of communication and dialogue between the Chinese and US militaries after the leaders' meeting will help reduce risks and miscalculations.""Military security has always been a potential risk point… after the two heads of state set the direction, the corresponding working level would enter the concrete implementation stage,"" Zhou said. Lü also believes that if the two sides can restore political trust to a certain extent, there will be dialogue in the military field.The two militaries may have started to contact each other at the working level, but it will take some time for dialogue to take place at the defense minister level, during which the communications on some details are needed, Lü said. However, Chinese experts stressed that there are preconditions for resuming talks between the two militaries, the most important of which is the Taiwan question, which is at the core of China's interests, the political foundation of bilateral relations, and a  redline that should not be crossed. ""Next, China needs to see if the US' words are translated into actions… The US has a habit of being duplicitous. If their words and deeds are inconsistent, the military-to-military contacts will have no substantive meaning,"" Lü said. ""The channels of communication and dialogue between the two sides not only need to be restored, but also need to be further refined and implemented on some specific issues,"" Zhou said.For example, there are no quantified rules on the safe distance between Chinese and American military vessels. To ensure that there will be no accidents, the two sides need to communicate and even conduct mutual exercises to form a certain understanding, so as to avoid emergencies more effectively, Zhou said. The more channels of communication between the two sides and measures to manage risks, the better it will be to avoid the worst scenarios, Zhou said. Zhou stressed that there are many areas of cooperation between the Chinese and US militaries, but the US should not step on the red line or even cross it. As for ""what can be discussed and what is firmly opposed,"" China will stick to its consistent principles.                         "

The foreigner was George Hatem, known as Ma Haide in China, the first Westerner to ever become a CPC member and later obtain Chinese citizenship.In November 1933, Hatem, who had received his doctorate in medicine, heard about a tropical disease that was raging in Shanghai, which determined his decision to come to China from the US to relieve people of their suffering. In Shanghai, he met Soong Chingling and some Communist Party of China (CPC) revolutionaries. Under their influence, Hatem was actively involved in the CPC's revolutionary activities, his clinic often becoming a place for Party members to contact and meet.In June 1936, recommended by Soong, Hatem arrived in northern Shaanxi where he saw the real CPC and witnessed this extraordinary people's army with his own eyes.Hatem was impressed by the indomitable Red Army soldiers and their solidarity in the face of tremendous hardships. Once, during the march, the troops suffered from a severe shortage of necessities, and bouts of hunger and exhaustion. Seeing that Hatem was too tired to proceed, an old soldier fumbled in his pocket for a while and emerged with a small piece of rock candy, unwrapped it and gave it to Hatem. Against all odds, the army and the people were united as one. Such optimism was rarely seen in other places at that time in China. It inspired Hatem to remain in China for the rest of his life, as he believed that only such people could change the future of the country. In October 1936, after conducting interviews in Yan'an, Edgar Snow decided to leave, but Hatem decided to stay on, choosing northern Shaanxi as his base, and gave himself the Chinese name Ma Haide.After the three main forces of the Chinese Red Army converged in October 1936, Hatem, who had been appointed as public health advisor to the Central Military Commission of the CPC, stayed with the troops. On the battlefield, Hatem saw soldiers who braved all dangers on the front line, and who held their guns tight even after death. He saw high-ranking Red Army officers such as Zhu De and He Long offer their own horses to the injured. Young soldiers laid down their lives for the noble lofty ideal about a new China. Deeply moved, Hatem made another important decision in his life: He applied to join the CPC. His application was soon approved by the Party. In February 1937, Hatem officially joined the CPC. He said that he felt extremely delighted to be able to participate in this great cause of liberation and to be truly and centrally involved rather than being on the sidelines.In 1950, Hatem officially became a Chinese citizen, and was appointed Medical Consultant of the Ministry of Health of the PRC. He helped to establish the Central Dermatovenerology Institute, and devoted himself to the prevention and treatment of and research on venereal diseases and leprosy.Global Times                         "

They will not proactively threaten or attack anyone, but will deter nuclear blackmail from other countries, he said.A test launch of a JL-3 was allegedly carried out in June 2019, and Ren Guoqiang, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense at the time said that the scheduled tests were normal and were not aimed at any country or particular target.""China always adheres to a national defense policy that is defensive in nature and a military strategy of active defense.

Tan said the relevant departments of the two sides ""are maintaining communication and coordination"" in this regard.Earlier on Saturday, the Chinese Defense Ministry announced that Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe will attend the 9th ADMM-Plus and visit Cambodia from Sunday to Thursday on the invitation of Phnom Penh.Wei will deliver a speech at the conference and hold meetings with the heads of delegations of some participating countries on the sidelines, exchanging views on international and regional situations and defense security cooperation, the ministry announced in a statement. Wei will also meet and hold talks with Cambodian state and military leaders during his visit in the country, the statement said.Zhuo Hua, an international affairs expert at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy of Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday that if Wei's meeting with US Secretary of Defense Austin Lloyd takes place during the ADMM-Plus, it means that both sides are implementing the consensus of keeping open strategic dialogue that the top leaders of the two countries reached on the sidelines of the just-concluded G20 summit in Bali, Indonesia.Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the meeting between the presidents of the two countries is guiding China-US exchanges to reach new breakthroughs in different areas.""The meeting between the defense chiefs is positive, as even though the two sides can't realize agreements on some specific issues, they can at least put joint efforts into managing potential risks and dangers,"" Li noted.""The US Defense Department desperately wants to make military diplomacy with China cover the operational level of war, and the Chinese military has always upheld the tradition of safeguarding regional and world peace via military diplomacy, so China holds a proactive and open attitude for communication and coordination with defense departments of different countries worldwide, including the US,"" Zhuo said.Although the meeting between the Chinese and US defense chiefs meets the anticipation of the two countries and the international community, ""we should be cautious to the outcome of the dialogue, because since US President Joe Biden came to power, we found the US military has failed to implement their president's positive promise in some operations on keeping the US-China ties away from conflict and a new cold war,"" Zhuo said.On topics like the South China Sea and the Taiwan question, both sides will surely communicate, but these problems between the two major powers cannot be resolved in the short term. During their upcoming exchanges, the Chinese side can stress the importance and sensitivity of relevant topics to strengthen the appreciation of where the bottom-line is in the mind of the US side, Li said.  Duplicity is a long-standing problem of the US military, as although it sometime controls its hostile and provocative tones to prevent angering China too much, its military operations to contain China and threatening China's sovereignty and national security have never stopped, Zhuo said. ""This makes it very difficult for the two sides to build mutual trust,"" Zhuo noted.  The US desire of having military diplomacy with China is based on assumptions about how to manage conflict and crisis if the two sides have military frictions some day, but China eyes how to fundamentally safeguard and improve peace and stability for the region and the world, so China wants to build a crisis management mechanism based on real political and strategic mutual trust, Zhuo told the Global Times.""Therefore, if the US military is sincere in wishing to work with the Chinese side to jointly manage military ties between the two countries, they should work together with their Chinese counterparts to meet each other halfway,"" Zhuo said.

While an aerial refueling cannot reload munitions for an aircraft, it does not require a landing and takeoff, and it can further increase the range and operating radius of the aircraft, the expert said.This is also the first time an official report has displayed a YU-20 hosting an aerial refueling for a J-10, as well as the first time an official report has displayed a YU-20 using its refueling point on its tail in an aerial refueling, observers said. Previously, the PLA Air Force has shown the YU-20 hosting aerial refueling for J-20 and J-16 fighter jets with refueling points under its wings. It shows that the YU-20 is compatible with many different types of aircraft, and it is expected that other types of aircraft with aerial refueling probes, including the KJ-500A early warning aircraft and the H-6N bomber, can also work with the YU-20, the expert said.The KJ-500A is a new variant of the KJ-500 early warning aircraft that made its debut at the Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in early November, and the H-6N is the latest member of the H-6 bomber family, which made first public appearance during the National Day military parade on October 1, 2019 in Beijing.As with fighter jets, aerial refueling can extend the range, operating radius and flight time for these larger aircraft, which have important tactical and even strategic significance, analysts said.                          "

The two countries should adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, so that both sides can ensure China-US relations are heading toward the right direction together - no going off course, no stalling, and surely no collision.China bears no responsibility for the situation China-US relations is facing now, as its main cause is the wrong strategic judgement by the US, Wei said.China attaches great importance to the development of relations between the two countries and the two militaries, but the US side must respect China's core interests, the Chinese defense minister said.He expressed the hope that the US could keep its words and promises, truly implement the consensuses reached by the two heads of state, and adopt rational and pragmatic policies toward China, and effectively eliminate the root of the cause of crisis, so as to push bilateral relations back to the track of healthy and stable development.The US does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to revitalize alliances against China, does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" does not support ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan,"" and has no intention to have a conflict with China, Biden said in his meeting with Xi last week.Wei-Austin meeting on Tuesday is the first time the two countries' defense chiefs have met personally since Pelosi's provocative visit to the Taiwan island in August, and the second time this year. The two had already met in Singapore at the International Institute for Strategic Studies' 19th Shangri-La Dialogue in June.The meeting reportedly lasted about 90 minutes, longer than the June meeting which took about an hour, therefore allowing more topics to be discussed this time, experts said.Right after Pelosi's reckless Taiwan visit, the PLA launched large-scale military exercises around the island, including launching conventional ballistic missiles over it, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced countermeasures including canceling the China-US Theater Commanders Talk, Defense Policy Coordination Talks and Military Maritime Consultative Agreement meetings.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday that a meeting between the two defense chiefs in itself is a positive signal, as Pelosi's provocative visit to Taiwan island saw the two countries' military ties falling to rock-bottom.It is always better for the two militaries to ease tensions, and it would serve no good to anyone if an unexpected military conflict breaks out between China and the US, Song said, adding that hopefully the American side can also seize the situation, as they should realize there is no room for compromise for the Chinese on the Taiwan question, Song said.Wei reiterated China's firm stance on the Taiwan question to Austin, as heemphasized that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests and the first insurmountable red line in China-US relations. Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and the settlement of the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own affair and brooks no foreign interference.Similar phrases were first used by Xi in his meeting with Biden last week, as Xi stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations.Wei also told Austin that China's complete reunification must be and can be realized, and the Chinese military has the backbone, confidence and ability to resolutely safeguard national unification.Over some time, the US has been blurring, hollowing out and distorting its one-China policy, frequently selling arms to the island of Taiwan, assisting in training the island's troops and sending senior officials to the island, which further escalated tensions in the Taiwan Straits, Tan said.""Every US escalation and breakthrough on the Taiwan question is bound to meet China's resolute and powerful countermeasure,"" Tan said.Resolving the Taiwan question has always been an important objective in the PLA's development, and as demonstrated in the ""island encirclement"" drills in August, the PLA is fully capable of locking down the island from external military interference, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Tuesday.The US must understand that interfering in the Taiwan question militarily is playing with fire and will not end up well for it, the expert said.Wei and Austin also compared notes on the international and regional situation, and on issues including the Ukraine crisis, the South China Sea and the Korean Peninsula.These issues cover not only the Asia-Pacific region, but also Europe, as the world nowadays is not a peaceful place with the US deeply involved, observers said, The US should not be fanning the flames around the world or instigating instabilities for its own hegemony, analysts said.But generally speaking, the meeting had good results as it was beneficial for both sides to improve understanding and avoid misjudgments, Tan said. For the next step, the two sides will keep communicating, implement the two countries' top leaders' important consensus together, and make efforts to put China-US military ties back on the right track, he said.

""It is likely at the same level or even slightly better than its US counterpart.""Five variants of the Taihang engines were displayed at the Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in early November, as its maker Aero Engine Corp of China said that the Taihang engine has kept receiving improvements and upgrades, and its performance, reliability, safety, stealth capability, power extraction, environmental adaptability, endurance and thrust vectoring - among other factors - have all received technical boosts. This is expected to  the aircraft's survivability and combat capabilities, and it has realized the complete independent support of domestically developed engines.In addition to the domestically developed engine for the J-15, Chinese military observers are eagerly anticipating new information on new carrier-based aircraft, including a catapult-launched and upgraded version of the J-15, a next-generation carrier-based stealth fighter jet allegedly called the J-35, a carrier-based early warning aircraft allegedly named the KJ-600 and a carrier-based version of the JL-10 advanced trainer, following the launch of the country's third carrier, the Fujian, which is for the first time equipped with electromagnetic catapults.

Military,By Leng Shumei   |  2022/11/23 22:00:39,"PLA Eastern Theater Command's J-10C fighters hold interception exercise in far sea, show growing skills, confidence ","Two J-10C fighters have conducted interception training in the far sea recently organized by the Eastern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), China Central Television reported.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-13/e12bfb78-e1e0-4785-af4d-3518c62b5ed9.jpeg," It is reportedly the first time that a Chinese official media outlet revealed details of far-sea interception training by the PLA Eastern Theater Command, which experts said show the PLA's increasing capacity and confidence in high-sea combat.According to a CCTV report on Tuesday, during the interception training, two J-10C fighters headed for target airspace in battle formation. The wingman sent a warning signal to the lead pilot when it was followed by an enemy plane. When the wingman tried to get rid of the enemy plane, the lead plane operated radar system to intercept the enemy plane and achieved conditions for weapon release to counter the enemy plane. J-10C is an improved version of J-10 which made its first appearance in 2018. The CCTV report on Tuesday said that the pilots that had attended the recent training had just finished switching to the new aircraft and it was the first time that they had flown the new aircraft during air-to-air combat training in the far sea. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the PLA continues to modify its equipment, indicating that the PLA's technologies are growing mature and innovative. On the other hand, the switch to new aircraft is also needed as the front-line troops put forward more requirements for the equipment for after combat training.PLA's pilots have a very good mechanism to communicate with military industry manufacturers and institutes over their experience in using the equipment, Song noted.Interception in the far sea is very difficult. Revealing the details of the PLA Eastern Theater Command's interception exercise in the CCTV report indicates the PLA's increasing capacity and confidence in high-sea combat, Song stressed.Lacking references and markers, it is easy for pilots to be dazzled and become disoriented in the far sea, not to mention that the situation could be very complex in actual combat. In addition, potential opponents the Eastern Theater Command faces, including the US and Japan, are very capable, Song explained.Successful interception of the enemy in the far sea means a lot for China in safeguarding its airspace and maritime security. As China has set up an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, it is a must for the Eastern Theater Command to possess the capacity to safeguard the zone, Song noted.J-10C have undergone updates in engine, aerodynamic configuration, avionics flight control system and radar system, after which it has been developed into a world-leading 4.5th generation aircraft.The latest modification is very likely aimed at optimizing its internal system and improving the weapons it carries, according to Song. ""For example, to make its operation system more agile and easy to use, to improve the capacity of its radar system or to develop for it a fire controlling system that suits new types of ammunition,"" Song said. As a single-engine medium-sized aircraft, J-10C's low oil carrying capacity is a disadvantage in performing interception missions in the far sea. But low oil carrying capacity dose not equal small combat radius. With flexible tactics, medium-sized aircraft can respond quickly, which is a necessary quality to deal with emergency missions like interception, Song explained. Low production and maintenance cost of single-engine aircraft is also another huge advantage, experts noted. Heavy multi-purpose aircraft like J-16 and medium-sized aircraft like J-10C are both sharp weapons of the country to safeguard airspace and maritime security, and they both need to be practice their combat skills and tactics in the far sea, Song stressed.

He also stressed that the Chinese military's growth and strength will always be in favor of world peace but the Chinese military has the confidence and capability to defeat any intruders, reaffirming China's bottom-line on the Taiwan question.Analysts noted that despite efforts by the US and other external forces to internationalize the Taiwan question, China and ASEAN nations have the wisdom to prevent conflicts like that which occurred in Ukraine to happen in Asia.Under the theme ""Solidarity for Harmonized Security,"" the 9th ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus (the 9th ADMM-Plus) was held in Cambodia on Wednesday to discuss ways to strengthen security, stability and prosperity in the region and the world. Defense ministers from ASEAN and its dialogue partners, including China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, Australia and the US attended the meeting.While delivering a speech at the 9th ADMM-Plus, Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe stressed that as world peace and development faces major challenges, the right way is to build a community with a shared future for mankind, which is also where the world's future lies. ""We need solidarity not division, fairness not hegemony, openness not blockage, mutual benefit not selfishness,"" Wei said, noting countries should jointly shape and maintain a regional order that balances the concerns of all parties and serves their interests. Observers said that this is Wei's first overseas visit after the conclusion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which highlights that China attaches great importance to ASEAN in the defense and security domains and in bilateral relations. The meeting between China's defense minister and his ASEAN counterparts is crucial because external powers have intensified their attempts to pull military alliances and incite conflict, posing a growing threat to regional stability.The US is attempting to sow similar turmoil in Asia after igniting the Russia-Ukraine conflict through NATO's eastern expansion and inflaming tensions between Russia and the West, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.Wei's statement is a response to interference of forces from outside the region, particularly those from the US, as it has kept making provocations and instigations over hot topics like the Taiwan question and the South China Sea issue, a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Wednesday, requesting anonymity.  Wei also stressed on Wednesday that China does not covet the interests of other countries, but its resolve to defend its own interests is as firm as a rock, reiterating China's position on the Taiwan question.Taiwan is part of China and resolving the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese, adding the Chinese military is unyielding, assured, confident and able to defeat any intruders., Wei delivered a similar message, emphasizing that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests and the first insurmountable red line in China-US relations.Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and the settlement of the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own affair and brooks no foreign interference, he stressed. Wei also told Austin that China's complete reunification must be and can be realized, and the Chinese military has the backbone, confidence and ability to resolutely safeguard national unification.The cross-Straits situation has deteriorated, especially after US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's highly provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in early August, which has also worried regional countries. Moreover, aside from trying to internationalize the Taiwan question and touting its China-threat rhetoric, the US has also ramped up pulling small cliques, pushing the military alliance NATO's expansion to Asia and forging military alliances, including AUKUS in the Asia-Pacific region, which analysts said may lead to arms races and more disturbance. How to thwart external forces from fomenting conflicts in the region has become an urgent issue for China and ASEAN members. As for the international community's displeasure with the US for its reckless role in the Ukraine issue and other international affairs, ASEAN members are becoming more watchful of US actions in the area, Li said.China has shown willingness and sincerity to positively interact, communicate and work with Southeast Asian countries in jointly safeguarding peace and stability in the region, including around the island of Taiwan and in the South China Sea, and the US' true face as a troublemaker in the region is also exposed, the anonymous expert said. ""With more cooperation and solidarity, there will be fewer loopholes for forces from outside the region to exploit,"" the expert said. While addressing the Wednesday meeting, Wei said that China has always committed to injecting stability and positive energy to the world. China's peaceful development will offer new opportunities for global development and will play as a constructive role in defending world peace and stability. The Chinese military is a peaceful military and is willing to work with the militaries of other countries to continue contributing to world peace. The Chinese defense chief noted that while the security in Asia has remained stable, there are also concerns. He said at the conference that the defense departments of all countries should uphold the centrality of ASEAN, practice the Global Security Initiative, focus on pragmatic cooperation and work together to build a solid barrier for universal security.Li said that Wei's participation at the ASEAN Military Ministers' Meeting-Plus  illustrates the consistency of China's defense strategy, which entails defending domestic sovereignty, preserving regional peace and pursuing mutually beneficial relationships with neighbors. The Chinese defense chief's emphasis on regional cooperation and seeking common interests is actually the mainstream of the defense ministers' meeting. For example, Cambodia's Defense Minister Tea Banh said the Wednesday meeting was crucial to discuss solutions to potential security challenges that pose threats to regional and global peace and development.More ASEAN and Asian nations are paying close attention on how to improve coordination to ensure regional prosperity rather than following the US' lead on contentious issues, according to experts. Regional leaders also have the wisdom and capability to resist any attempt that sabotages the stability in the region.                         "

There are fears that the US is attempting to create an Asian version of the Ukraine crisis using the leverage of the Taiwan question or the South China Sea issue, he said.In his meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Tuesday, Wei reiterated the red line of the Taiwan question once again, emphasizing that the Taiwan question is the core of China's core interests and the first insurmountable red line in China-US relations. Taiwan is China's Taiwan, and the settlement of the Taiwan question is the Chinese people's own affair and brooks no foreign interference.The military tensions between China and the US in the West Pacific are still high, and under such circumstances, China has made it clear that its national security interests must not be challenged, Chen Xiangmiao, director of the world navy research center at the National Institute for South China Sea Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.Whether it is the conflict between Russia and Ukraine or the situation across the Taiwan Straits, they are all related to regional security, Chen said. The discussion on security is not only between China and the US, which is why China has also called for conversations among multiple countries and regions, he said.China has made it clear that it will realize its great national rejuvenation through peaceful means and push forward its modernization peacefully, Chen noted. Meanwhile, when it comes to safeguarding China's own national security interests, it has no room for compromise, Chen said.                         "

As the conflict continues to further drag in a stalemate, it has been triggering more worries from the international community especially after the latest airstrikes on Ukraine cities, knocking out power and water service, and according to media reports, this is the largest strike that Russia has launched against infrastructure in Ukraine since November 15.Ukraine's capital Kiev, the western city of Lviv and the southern city of Mykolaiv were among multiple areas reporting missile strikes. The UN Security Council called an emergency meeting on Ukraine on Wednesday, during which Chinese Ambassador Geng Shuang said the ongoing conflict in Ukraine has led to constant attacks on civilian facilities and the steady rise of civilian casualties and displaced persons, which is a very worrying development. There is no winner in conflicts and wars.Geng noted that the international community should work together to support all efforts for the peaceful resolution of the crisis in Ukraine and avoid escalation of the conflict and prevent the emergence of a nuclear crisis.Chinese military expert Song Zhongping said that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is currently at a stalemate while tensions have been built since 2014. Russia's airstrikes against strategic targets in Ukraine aim to further impair Ukraine's military potential, push it to take a realistic position at talks and gain itself more leverages in negotiations with the US, an expert on international security who asked for anonymity, told the Global Times.The UN meeting on Wednesday had also become another battlefield as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky appealed to the UN via video link to take action to stop Russian airstrikes. US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield accused Russia of ""weaponizing winter"" while Russian diplomat Vasily Nebenzya told the UN meeting that remarks from Zelensky and his allies cannot be interpreted as ""readiness for peace but is rather a language of reckless threats and ultimatums."" The Russia-Ukraine conflict is still far from reaching its tipping point because neither the US nor the EU, or Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, have made any significant policy changes, the anonymous expert said, instead, the US continues to fan the flames, and the EU is being forced to swallow the bitter pill without being able to change anything. He noted that it is also not easy to promote talks between Russia and Ukraine as the Biden administration sees the current situation as an achievement and attempts to prolong the situation to win  more political capital. On Wednesday, the Biden administration announced $400 million in additional military aid for Ukraine. Among the arms being shipped are 150 heavy machine guns with special thermal-imagery sights to help shoot down self-destructing drones as well as ammunition for an air defense system, US media said citing Pentagon officials. Song, the military expert, told the Global Times that currently, the military equipment the US and some Western countries have sent to Ukraine are mostly light and medium weapons, with the heaviest ones being the likes of armored vehicles, M142 HIMARS and the M777 howitzers. Large and heavy weapons and equipment are not being provided. The military battles would likely become more intense if the US and NATO send additional mercenary forces equipped with heavy weaponry to back Ukraine - this would be the focus to observe in the future clashes in Ukraine and will also mean more tragedies for Europe, Song said. By inciting the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the US has made great fortune by supplying energy to the EU, realizing its goal of containing Russia and strengthening trans-Atlantic partnership, while Russia has greatly consumed its national strength and exposed some domestic problems and Ukraine, who has been staying at the core of the battlefield, have undermined its economy, social stability, and the well-being of the people, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Europe's losses are no less than Russia's as Europe continues to suffer from high inflation and pays a huge price for its energy security, said Cui.On Tuesday, Ukraine also received a new 2.5 billion euros tranche of financial support from the EU, Reuters reported. Following the European Council meeting in October 2022, the EU Commission had also proposed an unprecedented support package for Ukraine of up to 18 billion euros for 2023, according to a release from the commission. However, voices advocating spending more money to solve issues closely related to people's livelihoods are getting louder within the bloc as European countries are facing probably one of the most difficult winters with soaring energy prices and severe inflation, analysts said.The heavy price for the Russia-Ukraine conflicts have been put on the people and they will suffer more if the conflicts continue or deteriorate and the governments in related countries should take concrete actions to protect their own people and their national interests instead of only serving US' geopolitical interests, analysts said. Cui also noted that the tension between Russia and Ukraine has reached such a level that needs some other countries to stand out for mediation and promoting dialogues, for example, China, Turkey and India.  More countries are also calling related parties in the Ukraine crisis to remain restraint given the humanitarian problems caused by the conflicts and its spillover effect to the global economy and stability. On Wednesday, Chinese Ambassador Geng said at the UN meeting that the humanitarian situation in Ukraine under conflict is dire and the cold weather will significantly aggravate the plight of the people. He called on all parties concerned to act with prudence, ensure the safety of nuclear facilities and avoid causing man-made nuclear accidents.                          "

Instead, yearly expert videoconferences and a series of academic symposiums were held by the Xiangshan Forum Secretariat.So far, 40 experts from 14 countries and one international organization have confirmed they will attend this year's event, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said a press conference on Thursday.The international security situation has been worsening since 2020, of which the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a typical reflection as it broke the peace and stability in Europe that had been sustained for 30 years since the Cold War ended, and it has lasted for a longer period than anyone predicted, Zhao noted.The impact of the conflict on international security is huge, leading to various problems including a refugee crisis, food crisis and energy crisis while exacerbating the economic downturn, Zhao said.At the same time, China-US relations are faced with much uncertainty, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread, and climate change deeply affects humans' survival and development. All these factors combine together and trigger public concern over the international security environment, Zhao said.Countries share a mutual understanding of the current international security situation but each has its own solution to it. The US' solution, for example, is Cold War thinking and a zero-sum game. ""The US divides the countries in the world into different ranks, sets up strategic competitors, exaggerates the competition between major powers, strengthens the alliance system, and engages in 'integrated deterrence.' The key words of their solution are competition, containment and suppression. The US particularly emphasizes military priority as the military is the most useful and most immediately effective tool in its strategic toolbox. Isn't there a saying: no matter where there is a crisis in the world, the US president must first ask where the US aircraft carriers are at that moment,"" Zhao said.China's solution, on the contrary, relies on mutual respect and win-win cooperation and is attentively embodied in the Global Security Initiative (GSI), according to Zhao.The GSI was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping at the opening ceremony of the 2022 Boao Forum. Focused on six core areas, the initiative serves as China's solution to the strained international security situation. ""The GSI attaches great importance to the legitimate security concerns of all countries and emphasizes common security and different divisions of security, which clearly surpasses Western national security theories. Which of the proposals of China and the US, or any other solution proposed by a third country, can deal with the complex situation of the current world? We hope that experts and scholars from all over the world will express their opinions at the platform provided by the Beijing Xiangshan Forum,"" Zhao said.Themed on getting together to promote the GSI and safeguard peaceful development, this year's expert videoconference will closely focus on the key word of security and discuss six topics, including the stability and development in the Asia-Pacific region, the impact of regional conflicts on global security, and the changing and unchanging patterns of war.Experts and scholars to attend the conference include those from the US, Russia, India, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. They are expected to engage in heated exchanges over hot issues like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and China-US ties, Zhao predicted.For example, Graham Allison, Douglas Dillon Professor of Government at Harvard University and the author of  and Andrey Kortunov, director general of the Russian International Affairs Council, will express their opinions during a section titled ""Major countries' pursuit of their own interests and share of global security responsibilities.""According to Allison's theory of Thucydides Trap, when a rising power threatens to displace a ruling one, the most likely outcome is war.""We decided to invite Allison as we hope he can share his recent observations and thinking on China-US ties and whether he has changed his ideas,"" Zhao said.Kortunov is also a famous and influential scholar and once served in the government. He is also interested in the topic as to whether war is destined to break out between major powers especially between China and the US. But apparently he holds a different idea from Allison based on published material, according Zhao. ""Any country has its own interests that need to be safeguarded, but there are legitimate and illegitimate interests: survival interests and development interests are legitimate and every country needs to safeguard them. But for superpowers, to safeguard the interests of hegemony and group camps, they often have to go beyond their own legitimate interests. Therefore, this section is set to focus on where is the boundary of a country's legitimate security interests, or where is the balance between the pursuit of a major country's own interests and the responsibility for global security,"" Zhao explained.This year's expert videoconference also invited many military attachés in China from some foreign countries. This will be conducive to exchanges and interaction between foreign military and Chinese military scholars, and also demonstrate the openness and transparency of the Chinese military. Military attachés in China will also have the opportunity to gain an in-depth understanding of Chinese ideas and proposals like the GSI, and the promotion of the establishment of a community with a shared future for mankind, Zhao said.The ninth Beijing Xiangshan Forum held in 2019 witnessed a record number of participants including 23 defense ministers, six chief of the army and another 23 deputy minister-level officials from the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Africa and Latin America.The forum is a public security product China provided to the world. It has become a vital platform for middle and small countries to express their voices and relevant parties to disputes to exchange ideas, according to Zhao.For example, in 2019, senior officials from North Korea and South Korea attended the forum and interacted; scholars from Israel and Iran also appeared and communicated, according to Zhao.

Another advantage is that 3D printing is fast, and parts can be quickly manufactured, which makes logistics support simpler and less costly, he said.The Shenyang Aircraft Company, a subsidiary of the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China, is known as the cradle of Chinese fighters, having built main combat warplanes of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) from the country's first generation J-5 fighter jet to the modern J-15 carrier-based fighter jet and the J-16 multirole fighter jet. It also developed China's second stealth fighter jet, the FC-31, which is available for export, and is also expected to be further developed into China's next generation carrier-based fighter jet, according to analysts.3D printing technologies have now been implemented in major aircraft manufacturing factories of the Chinese aviation industry, making China a country to use such technologies on a large scale, the CCTV report said.This means aircraft manufactured not only by Shenyang Aircraft Company, but also by other Chinese aircraft makers are using 3D printing technologies, observers said.

During the training program, a formation of the two vessels intercepted missiles from enemy aircraft and became qualified in tests of air defense, a video PLA Navy released on China's Twitter-like Sina Weibo platform showed on Sunday. Since the training program started, the Guangxi has completed all the subjects of training and built up overall operational capability as an amphibious assault platform, Captain Xu Ce, skipper of the Guangxi, was quoted by China Central Television as saying.During the program, the Hainan and the Guangxi focused on training on core capacities including multidimensional troop delivery and self-defense, and completed full-course qualification test scenarios which effectively enhanced their core operational capacities, the video showed.The Hainan and the Guangxi are the PLA Navy's first and second Type 075 amphibious assault ships with hull numbers 31 and 32. As the PLA's first two amphibious assault ships, the two vessels' success in fulfilling the evaluation indicates that they had built up their operational capacities. This will serve as vital experience for the PLA to deliver more amphibious assault ships and train their crews and enhance their operational capacities, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.Such experience will help the PLA to significantly shorten the period between the delivery of an amphibious assault ship and building up its operational capacity, according to Song. He noted that in order to safeguard national territorial integrity and national sovereignty in the Taiwan Straits and the South China Sea, the PLA Navy needs a large number of amphibious assault ships. The Hainan was commissioned on April 23, 2021, and the Guangxi made its first public appearance in April this year after its commissioning.The Anhui, the country's third Type 075 amphibious assault ship with hull number 33, conducted realistic combat-oriented training earlier this month, which analysts said indicated that the vessel has entered active service.Delivering three amphibious assault ships into active service and forming their combat capacities in less than two years indicated the PLA's determination and its urgency to develop advanced weapons, military analysts pointed out.With more Type 075s readying for combat, the PLA Navy will become more confident in far sea and amphibious operations, as the ships have significant advantages in amphibious landings, they noted.

On October 14, the two countries held the 25th meeting of the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on China-India border affairs, during which the two sides spoke highly of the achievements made in the disengagement of border troops. The two countries held the 16th round of the China-India Corps Commander Level Meeting in July, and reached a four-point consensus on the resolution of border issues between China and India. After the conflict in the western section of the China-India border in 2020, both sides stepped up their military configurations as well as infrastructure in the eastern section, Lin Minwang, a professor at the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. ""In a way, it was not surprising that both sides would clash in the eastern section of the border.""However, both sides have continued to negotiate at various levels over the past several years. This shows that both sides want to maintain stability in their relations and that the border situation is stable, Lin said.What is worth noting is that historically, conflicts on the India-China border rarely occur in winter, Lin said. The expert believed that it is possible that India has chosen this timing to start a conflict in an attempt to release a certain message.For India, the expert said, at the strategic level, it needs to signal to the outside world that China-India relations are tense, which is related to maintaining its position in front of the US, and that India also wants to sustain its strategy of balanced diplomacy.However, he believes the conflict is unlikely to affect the situation between China and India in the border region.

Integrating unmanned equipment and conducting simulated exercises are good ways to enhance troop combat capabilities and lower casualties, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Monday.Under the PLA Eastern Theater Command, the 71st Group Army faces the real combat need of urban warfare in a possible scenario of reunification-by-force of the island of Taiwan following amphibious landing, and that is why preparations must be made, the expert said.The Linfen Brigade got its name from the Linfen Campaign during the War of Liberation (1946-49), in which the brigade seized the city of Linfen in North China from Kuomintang forces, leading Mao Zedong to say the campaign ""set a successful example for urban offensive combat,"" the PLA Daily reported.

This is cheaper than using non-stealth aircraft launching expensive, long-range standoff missiles, he said.One of the main reasons why the B-21 was developed is that the B-2 is too expensive to build and to maintain, another Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.The B-21 is smaller and lighter than the B-2, and uses only two engines instead of four. These result in decreases in range and payload capacity, but in return it is allegedly more cost-effective friendlier, with the US Air Force planning to procure around 100 units, compared with around 20 B-2 aircraft, the expert said.Since the B-21 was revealed, US media reports were quick to spin connections with China, with analysts saying that the move is aimed at deterring China and gaining sufficient funds for follow-up developments.The B-21 is a part of the Pentagon's efforts to modernize all three legs of its nuclear triad, which includes silo-launched nuclear ballistic missiles and submarine-launched warheads, as it shifts from the counterterrorism campaigns of recent decades to meet China's rapid military modernization, AP reported on Saturday.A large fleet of B-21s will pose new challenges to China's air defense, as they can launch sneak attacks from more directions, taking advantage of their stealth capabilities: not only from the West Pacific, but also from the South China Sea, and even territorial airspaces of Southeast and South Asian countries as well as countries in the Middle East, Chinese experts said. In those sneak attacks, the US bombers could target Chinese command centers, bases, airfields and missile facilities, creating breaches in the anti-access and area denial systems of the Chinese military, they warned.To counter the B-21s, China can attack the airfields from which the US bombers are based with own bombers, and China has whatever it takes to build a similar bomber to the B-21, Zhang said.China has repeatedly hinted at the development of its own next-generation bomber reportedly called the H-20, which is expected to also have a flying wing aerodynamic design like the B-2 and the B-21.The B-21 is expected to make its first flight in 2023, AP reported. However, given the precedent of delays as well as cost hikes of the B-2, the F-22 and the F-35, the future of the B-21 may not go as smoothly as planned, observers said.                         "

If it repeatedly breaks its promise, acts recklessly, and connives and supports Taiwan secessionists, it will inevitably aggravate the tensions in the Taiwan Straits and eventually draw fire to burn itself,” Tan noted. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will take all necessary measures to resolutely defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and resolutely defeat any form of external interference and separatist plots for “Taiwan secessionism,” Tan said in the statement.Observers also slammed the US’ consecutive provocations over China’s red line, only a few weeks after the top leaders of the two countries met in Bali, in what had been seen as an opportunity for easing bilateral relations. US President Joe Biden reaffirmed that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence"" and has no intention of engaging in conflict with China, but what the US is doing goes against that assertion. The South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative (SCSPI), a Beijing-based think tank, detected a US P-8A anti-marine aircraft flying over the Taiwan Straits on Thursday.According to a US State Department notice obtained by Bloomberg, the Biden administration has proposed selling Taiwan island as many as 100 of its most advanced , as well as radar and support equipment in a deal valued at $882 million. The NDAA, which is currently going through the US Congress, includes the Taiwan Enhanced Resilience Act (TERA), which would authorize $2 billion in annual military aid for five years, providing grants and loans to the island of Taiwan to purchase US military equipment, services and training, Reuters reported. It also authorizes another $1 billion annually of emergency defense assistance to Taiwan island. A proposal that Taiwan be treated as a ""major non-NATO ally"" was removed from the bill. Loans are not free aid, and the US is treating the island as a cash cow, trapping the DPP into debt while the burden is placed on all common people in Taiwan island, as the money could have been used to improve their livelihoods, Song said. China should give the US a stern warning over its violation of promises and repeated provocations, experts said, adding that such US moves would only consolidate the Chinese mainland’s determination and morale for reunification.                          "

The package was approved after the outgoing US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's reckless visit to Taiwan island where she met with secessionists in August.China announced  in response to Pelosi's highly provocative tour, including halting China-US theater commanders talk, defense policy coordination talks, military maritime security consultative mechanism and suspending cooperation on illegal immigration repatriation, drug control and climate change.Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US says it supports the one-China policy, but its action is to pull Taiwan away from China.  US arms sale would be easily interpreted by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as a signal of support from the US for ""seeking independence"" and a blow to Taiwan compatriots' efforts to strengthen ties with the mainland, especially after the secessionists DPP's fiasco in the local elections, Li said. The US arms sale to Taiwan tramples on one of the cornerstones of the stability of the China-US relations and current international relations, namely the one-China principle, Li said. Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that arms sales to Taiwan could hinder the resumption of the halted military and other exchanges between China and the US. In November, some analysts were optimistic that China and US  and other aspects that were halted due to Pelosi's irresponsible moves after the first face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the world's two biggest economies since Biden took office at the G20 Summit in November. During the meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed that the Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests, the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations. Biden said at the meeting that the US does not support ""Taiwan independence,"" does not support ""two Chinas"" or ""one China, one Taiwan.""The US should take more substantive measures to stop provocations on the Taiwan question and convince China that it is sincere in improving China-US relations, rather than saying one thing and doing another, Xin said. ""Disclosing the arms sale at this point seems like saying that it will not give up playing the 'Taiwan card' to contain China and hinder China's reunification.""It cannot be ruled out that there are some extreme ideological conservative anti-China forces in the US, who are trying to block the momentum of the recent sound development of China-US relations, including the consensus reached between the two leaders in the G20, Li said. But no matter what happens inside the US, arms sales to Taiwan mean damage to China's core interests and interference in China's internal affairs, and China needs to give the US a serious warning over it, Li added. ""If arms sales do happen, China will not do nothing.""The US' arm sales to Taiwan in recent years have become increasingly aggressive with more powerful equipment. However, the 100 Patriot air defense missiles will not help the island of Taiwan gain a military edge over the Chinese mainland, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) can launch saturation attacks including those with hypersonic missiles and stealth aircraft that would completely overwhelm the island's air defense, said Chinese mainland analysts.According to Bloomberg, some 100 missiles of the hit-to-kill PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement are planned to be delivered to the island of Taiwan. This version of the Patriot missile allegedly has increased range and covers higher altitude against tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and warplanes thanks to the use of a dual pulse rocket engine and modified aerodynamic design, a Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity.But it will have no chance against the PLA's hypersonic missiles which no current air defense system is capable of intercepting; stealth-capable cruise missiles and warplanes can also destroy the installations undetected, creating openings for additional attacks, the expert said.The PLA Rocket Force operates the DF-17 short-to-medium range hypersonic missile, and the PLA Air Force just displayed a type of air-launched ballistic missile also believed to be hypersonic at Airshow China 2022, carried by the H-6K bomber.Aircraft like the J-20 fighter jet and the GJ-11 drone are stealth-capable, and a type of stealth cruise missile was carried by the J-16 fighter jet and the JH-7A fighter bomber displayed at Airshow China.The PLA can also simply pour a large number of munitions into saturation attacks, including inexpensive long-range rockets, which will outnumber the island of Taiwan's air defense missiles, the expert said.No matter what weapons the US sells to the island of Taiwan, there will be no change to the PLA's overwhelming advantage in the Taiwan Straits, analysts said.

Having a displacement of more than 80,000 tons, the vessel is the country's first one equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices, making China a step closer to the world's top level super carriers.Ten years ago, the PLA commissioned its first aircraft carrier, the , which was built from an unfinished Soviet hull. It is astounding to see how fast China's aircraft carrier program has progressed in these 10 years, observers said.In 2022, two new Type 075 amphibious assault ships, the  and the , three new Type 055 large destroyers, the , the  and the , and many other main surface combatants entered service with the PLA Navy. It means the PLA Navy has received more ships in one year than many other navies have in total.At the Airshow China 2022, held in Zhuhai, South China's Guangdong Province in November, the J-20 fighter jet of the PLA Air Force for the first time put a static display in front of the general public, with many details visible. It was announced that the independently developed stealth aircraft has entered all Eastern, Western, Southern, Northern and Central theater commands, indicating that the fighter jet is now in mass production, with US media outlet Defense News speculating that China has likely built more than 200 J-20s, surpassing the number of the US' F-22s.The PLA Air Force also displayed its new YU-20 aerial tanker and a new type of what seems to be air-launched hypersonic ballistic missile carried by the H-6K bomber at the event.In the large-scale exercises around the island of Taiwan in August, many of these advanced weapons and equipment, including the J-20 and the J-16 fighter jets, the YU-20 aerial tanker, the H-6K bomber, the modularized multiple rocket launcher system, conventional ballistic missiles, as well as multiple types of destroyers and frigates, demonstrated the PLA's capabilities in solving the Taiwan question and denying external forces from interfering, experts said.It was stressed at the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China held in October in Beijing that achieving  and more quickly elevating the people's armed forces to world-class standards are strategic tasks for building a modern socialist country in all respects.Looking into the future, the PLA will continue its rapid development aiming for the centenary goal in 2027, basically complete modernization by 2035 and become world-class by the mid-21st century.After the US revealed in December its new stealth bomber, the B-21, China is also expected to eventually unveil its next generation strategic bomber, the H-20, which is the last missing piece in China's strategic nuclear capability, Fu Qianshao, a Chinese military aviation expert, told the Global Times.When the H-20 is completed, it will be around the same level as, if not surpassing, the B-21, Fu said.By 2027, the country's third aircraft carrier, the , will likely be ready for combat, and equipped with new aircraft, including carrier-based stealth fighter jets and carrier-based early warning aircraft, and more advanced vessels, including the next generation frigate and the improved version of the Type 055 large destroyer, might enter service, said analysts, who also expect nuclear power for China's potentially in-development new aircraft carrier.With the development of new weapons and equipment in new domains and of new qualities, as well as the enhancement of joint combat capabilities as a system through realistic combat-oriented exercises, the PLA will become increasingly capable of safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests amid future uncertainties, observers said.

Any attempts to use the island to contain China or support the separatist forces for ""Taiwan independence"" will only further escalate tensions across the Taiwan Straits and undermine the political foundation of China-US relations, You said. ""Any provocation that attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests will be met with firm countermeasures,"" You said. The new act stipulates that  and $2 billion as military loans within five years, and will accelerate arms sales to the Taiwan island. This further indicates that some forces in the US are trying to support the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists with arms in the military, provoking confrontation across the Taiwan Straits and pushing the two sides of the Straits to the brink of war, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a statement on Saturday.Referring to the Taiwan question, Wang Yi, member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, state councilor and foreign minister, said on Sunday at the Symposium on the International Situation and China's Foreign Relations that ""we have not been intimidated by any hegemonic power or its bullying, and have acted resolutely to safeguard China's core interests and national dignity.""""The Taiwan question is at the very core of China's core interests. It is the bedrock of the political foundation of China-US relations, and a red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations,"" Wang said.Two days ago, Wang had a phone call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in which he pointed out that the US should not pursue dialogue and cooperation while containing and stabbing China in the back.The US legislated its arms sales to the Taiwan region, which seriously provoked China's core interests and sent a supportive signal to the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times on Sunday, saying that it was another serious escalation by the US in strengthening military ties with the island.In the future, the US is likely to sell advanced weapons and equipment to the Taiwan authorities instead of secondhand, defective weapons and equipment like it sold in the past, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times.Given that a formal opinion was also written into the act urging the Pentagon to have the Taiwan region be part of the 2024 Rim of the Pacific joint exercises, Song believes that Washington could push the Taiwan authorities, especially the local military, further into the international community and strengthen military exchanges, as well as send more troops to the island in an attempt to help the secessionist authorities resist the process of reunification. The defense act also requires the responsible authorities to prioritize and, with no bundled arrangement allowed, expedite the processing of Taiwan's arms purchase requests, which Song said would cause the Taiwan authorities to invest more money to buy more weapons and equipment, thus intensifying tensions across the Straits and making military conflicts more possible. Xin said that after the passage of the defense bill, an ""arms race"" and ""military conflicts"" are more possible but the island is far from capable of having an arms race with the Chinese mainland. The bill, which again exposed the US' continuous maneuvers of hollowing out and distorting the one-China principle, will surely trigger China's countermeasures, the expert warned.

The documents involve Japan's biggest military post-war build-up plan, with $320 billion to buy missiles ""capable of striking China,"" its ""greatest strategic challenge."" Japan uses Camp Yonaguni as a stronghold and front for its military strategy. By strengthening its military presence in the region, it tries to perform a deterrence to the People's Liberation Army by sending a signal that Tokyo is capable of intervening in the Taiwan Straits and the Diaoyu Islands, so as to better comfort Taiwan secessionists, Liu said. On December 11, policy chief of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Koichi Hagiuda said Japan needs to increase its military spending when meeting with secessionist leader Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan on December 11.  Chinese military experts Song Zhongping told the Global Times that given that Yonaguni is only a 28.9-square-kilometer island, it is more likely that Japan intends to use the surface-to-air guided missile unit to safeguard its intelligence and monitoring capability. Yonaguni is Japan's closest land to Taiwan island and to key military bases along the Chinese mainland's southeastern coast. Japan has been deploying monitoring stations on Yonaguni to snoop on activities of both the mainland and Taiwan. Therefore, Chinese experts said not only Yonaguni, but also the entire Ryukyu Islands is expected to be at the forefront of Japan's military deterrence against China in the next five years, with the ability to deploy weapons to strike important military installations within enemy territory. This means that in the future, Japan may completely get rid of its post-war pacifist image that was of great importance to its economic development, to become a country that poses a threat to its neighbors, develops its military industry, and is likely to use force abroad, Liu warned. This will be the biggest change in East Asia since World War II and will bring great danger to the whole Asia-Pacific region, Liu added.                          "

The PLA Southern Theater Command organized aerial forces to conduct tracking and monitoring through its entire course, Tian said.Despite multiple warnings from the Chinese side, the US aircraft suddenly altered its flight stance, pushed the Chinese aircraft toward left in a dangerous approach movement, which seriously compromised the flight safety of the Chinese military aircraft, severely violated the Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters between China and the US as well as related international law and practices, the spokesperson said.A video documenting the incident from the perspective of the Chinese J-11 fighter jet was attached to Tian's statement, which showed the US RC-135 intentionally altered its flight stance in a dangerous approach toward the Chinese aircraft at 11:25 am on December 21.From the video released by the Chinese side, it is obvious that the US aircraft actively maneuvered left toward the Chinese aircraft, verifying that it was the US side that engaged in dangerous moves, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Saturday.On the other hand, the video release by the US only showed the Chinese aircraft flying alongside the US aircraft without making any dangerous maneuvers, the expert said.The Chinese pilot took professional and standard action according to laws and regulations, fully reflecting the Chinese military's responsible attitude toward regional safety and the safety of frontline personnel, Tian said. ""The US side intentionally misled the public, called black white, blamed on China while itself is to be blamed and attempted to confuse international opinion,"" he said.""We sternly require the US to restrain the movements of its frontline maritime and aerial forces, strictly abide by related international laws and related agreements and prevent maritime and aerial accidents,"" Tian said.The Chinese military is on high alert at all times, as it will resolutely carry out its duties and missions, safeguarding national sovereignty and security, the spokesperson said.Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson from the China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular press conference on Friday in response to the incident that, for a long time, the US has frequently deployed aircraft and vessels for close-in reconnaissance on China, which poses a serious danger to China's national security.The US' provocative and dangerous moves are the root cause of maritime security issues, Wang said.""China urges the US to stop such dangerous provocations, and stop deflecting blame on China.

That is too small a number,"" Wei said, citing the PLA's missile strike capabilities working in tandem with naval and air forces.The PLA operates DF-21D and DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles capable of striking moving maritime targets like aircraft carriers at hypersonic speeds against which there is no defense, observers said.On Sunday, the PLA Eastern Theater Command organized cross-service joint alert patrol and realistic combat-oriented exercises in sea and aerial areas around the island of Taiwan, countering collusion between and provocations by external and ""Taiwan independence"" forces. Some 57 aircraft and four vessels of the PLA were detected around the island of Taiwan on the day, with 28 of the detected aircraft including fighters, bombers and drones crossing the so-called median line of the Taiwan Straits and entering the island's self-proclaimed southwest air defense identification zone, .It marked the first time the PLA Eastern Theater Command has announced a joint drill around the island of Taiwan in 2023, but such drills have become routine since at least 2020, and have grown with the increasing provocations by Taiwan secessionists and external interference forces.In 2022, the PLA sent 1,727 planes into the island of Taiwan's self-proclaimed air defense identification zone, compared with about 960 incursions in 2021 and 380 in 2020, AFP reported, citing releases by the defense authority on the island.The PLA's exercises have demonstrated that the Chinese mainland has the confidence, the will and the capability to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, another Chinese mainland military expert told the Global Times on Tuesday, requesting anonymity.If the US and Japan interfere in the Taiwan question militarily, not only will the US lose its nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, it will lose all of its footholds in the Asia-Pacific region, including military bases in Japan, Guam and even Australia, the expert said.One thing is right about the CSIS' war game predictions, and that is that the US and Japan will definitely be left crippled if they interfere in the Taiwan question, the expert said.The PLA Navy's Liaoning aircraft carrier group  in December 2022. Citing the CSIS report, CNN said that for US troops to prevent the Chinese mainland from ultimately taking control of the island of Taiwan, some constants emerged among the 24 war game iterations it ran, including that the US must be able to use its bases in Japan for combat operations and that the US needs to fully arm Taiwan before shooting starts and jump into any conflict with its own forces immediately, as it is impossible to get troops and supplies onto the island of Taiwan once the conflict starts.This is intentionally instigating the US and Japan to militarily interfere in the Taiwan question and encourage ""Taiwan independence"" forces in their secessionist moves, analysts said.The ill-intended war game will only give the ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist and external interference forces a false vision that will lead them to their doom. On the contrary, they should refrain from any military moves, fully understand that Taiwan is a part of China, realize the deterrent in the form of the PLA, and not overestimate their capabilities, experts said.

A single replenishment can fulfill the fresh water demand of an island with hundreds of people.Designed to transport personnel and goods to islands and reefs rapidly, the  passenger and cargo transport ship has a large bay under its front deck that enables the vessel to conduct supply missions under complex conditions.The  landing ship has a large deck allowing it to carry tanks in amphibious landing missions. It can also participate in disaster relief and maritime search and rescue missions.Despite being a small vessel, the  degaussing ship plays a key role in giving stealth to other warships. Magnetic fields are inevitably generated by the Earth's magnetic field around vessels as they sail. These magnetic fields make the vessels vulnerable targets to some weapons, and the degaussing ship's mission is to cleanse other vessels of their magnetic fields.The naval base is also the home port of the comprehensive replenishment ship , which is currently on an escort mission in the far sea.

However, without vertical tails, the new aircraft will lose out on maneuverability if it does not use other designs or technologies to compensate, like thrust vectoring control-capable engines and split brake rudders, or other innovative approaches, analysts said.With the project name Next Generation Air Dominance, the US’ next-generation fighter jet might also use a tailless design, according to a computer-generated rendering by US military warplane contractor Lockheed Martin, US news website Defense News reported in September 2022.Based on the information available now, China has started research and development in terms of the next-generation fighter jet, and it is in a confident place to eventually outpace the US, Fu said.

The discovery will serve as an important reference for the study of the formation and evolution of the Moon and will also boost the utilization of lunar resources, experts said.The research team from China Institute of Atomic Energy (CIAE), affiliated with the China National Nuclear Corporation, used neutron activation analysis and found that the chemical substances contained in the Chang'e-5 lunar samples were very different from those on Earth, China Central Television reported on Sunday. ""We mainly used nuclear reactors to study the samples, accurately testing over 40 chemical elements including macroelements, microelements, and trace elements in them,"" Guo Bing, head of the institute of nuclear physics at CIAE, was quoted as saying in the report. Experts noted that as the lunar soil is extremely precious, non-destructive studies of the samples can improve the efficiency of its use. In particular the neutron activation analysis, which has a high degree of accuracy, can not only determine exactly which elements the moon soil contain without destroying its morphology, but also tell the concentration by measuring the rays reflected by each element. ""For example, we can extract more than 30 kilograms of titanium from one ton of lunar samples, the content of which is more than six times the average of titanium on Earth. It provides very important basic data for our future exploration on the Moon and boosts the utilization of resources,"" Guo said. The research team further noted that they will study the isotopic content of the lunar samples, which according to Yang Yuguang, vice chairman of the Space Transportation Committee with the International Astronautical Federation, will serve as an important reference for the study of the formation and evolution of the Moon.  ""Most of the elements on Earth can be found on the Moon, but there are some differences in the isotopic content and a few different materials can only be found on the Moon. Among current Moon formation theories, the findings can best illustrate the giant-impact theory, which proposes that the Moon formed during a collision between the Earth and another small planet, about the size of Mars. However, this still needs a great amount of studies to prove,"" Yang told the Global Times on Sunday. Yang further elaborated that the study of Moon samples is currently focused on finding water and Helium-3. ""Scientists are studying whether the water on the Moon surface can be used, but so far all the samples retrieved have very little quantity of water. Explorations of the North and South Pole on the Moon may find soils that contain more water. Helium-3, one of the most ideal fuels for nuclear fusion, is very scarce on Earth but abundant on the Moon, which is of far-reaching significance for the sustainable development of human energy in the future.""

The successful launch marked the first victory of SAST new rocket type development in the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25). Developers said the news was a confidence boost as Shanghai is struggling with a COVID-19 flare-up.At launch, the rocket has a weight of 530 tons and is capable of sending payload of no less than 4 tons to the Sun-synchronous orbit. The new member of the Long March carrier rocket family is 50 meters in height and has two 3.35-meter-diameter stages with the first adopting a 120-ton-thrust liquid oxygen/kerosene engine and a 18-ton-thurst one for the second, said a statement the SAST provided to the Global Times on Tuesday.Marking a design breakthrough in the country's aerospace history, the new rocket has four 2-meter-diamter solid-propellant boosters attached to its body, developers said. The boosters also have two stages and have a thrust of 120 tons, which are developed by the Fourth Academy of the CASC.It is the first rocket type that has realized a cooperation of liquid and solid engines in China, clearing key technical barriers such as the solid boosters attachment and detachment technology, developers said. Such a hybrid-propellant technology would fully utilize the advantages of the two systems - the liquid engine has long working hours with high performance while the solid one has more powerful thrust and better reliability and is easy to maintain. The birth of the Long March-6A would further enrich the type of spectrum of China's rockets, enhancing China's capability in space exploration, analysts pointed out. Adopting a similar technological path, the US Atlas 5, Europe's Ariane 5 and H-2A of Japan have performed several successful flights. However, it was a first for a Chinese rocket in active service to perform a flight with solid boosters, developers added. The Long March-6A could also enable rapid launches with preparations of only 14 days thanks to the newly built launch site at the Taiyuan Center, which will meet the highly frequent launch requirement to the medium and low orbit satellites, insiders said. According to the developers, the Long March-6A also adopted a range of new technologies used at launch such as the ""unattended operation"" that started four hours before the blast-off, enhancing safety.To make the ""unattended operation"" a reality, the rocket must perform an automatic docking and fueling via remote control, the rocket ground connector should also automatically fall off at the moment of take-off and once the propellant injection starts, it requires no personnel to watch over at the launch pad, which all marked firsts in China. Hong Gang, the rocket type's commander-in-chief, told the Global Times on Tuesday that as the rocket is developed in a path of modularization, combination and modularization, it could also come in different variants according to the mission demand such as ones without boosters or other forms with two boosters.The Tuesday flight marked the 412nd mission of China's Long March rocket family. The rocket sent Tiankun-2 and Pujiang-2 satellites into their designated orbits on Tuesday. Tiankun-2 is a new technology experiment satellite developed by the Second Academy of China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC), and its developers told the Global Times on Tuesday that it could provide a range of services such as space science exploration.Inheriting the high functional density of Tiankun-1, the first experimental satellite independently developed by CASIC, which was sent into orbit in March 2017, Tiankun-2 has lower manufacturing costs and is smaller in size.The Tiankun-2 is tasked with verifying key technologies such as new attitude and orbit control algorithms, multi-functional flexible cladding materials, and computational optical imaging, satellite developers revealed.                          "

Xiang will join us soon, sources with the NAO told the Global Times on Thursday. ""Our results indicate that the formation of the galaxy's old (thick) disk started approximately 13?billion years ago, only 0.8 billion years after the Big Bang, and 2?billion years earlier than the final assembly of the inner galactic halo,"" read the published article. LAMOST has released tens of millions of items of stellar spectral data, becoming the cornerstone of the digital galaxy. ESA's Gaia satellite provides a map of the positions and movements of 1.4 billion stars. Such a perfect match gives astronomers a unique advantage in tracing the integration and evolution of the Milky Way, the NAO said. The LAMOST, one of China's first major astronomy projects, has helped the country discover the most massive stellar black hole and the most lithium-rich giant star ever known. It is expected to be moved from Hebei to the township of Lenghu in Northwest China's Qinghai Province, which has a clear night sky, with excellent astronomical viewing, and less atmospheric disturbance and light pollution. The relocation is expected to take about one year and further construction of the telescope in Lenghu will take another four years, the NAO revealed in December 2021.China released the eight-year survey dataset of the LAMOST in April 2021, according to the Xinhua News Agency. The report said that the number of spectra launched by the LAMOST is expected to break 20 million items by 2022.Finished in 2008, the LAMOST began regular surveys in 2012. In June of 2020, the eight-year spectrum survey was concluded. Before the LAMOST was built, humans could observe more than 10 billion celestial bodies, while only one in 10,000 had ever been observed through the spectrum, Xinhua reported.                          "

In the first lecture, students from Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions participated in the class. Students from Xinjiang and Xizang passionately raised questions that they have observed in comparison with their daily lives, including whether water can boil in space or has a lower boiling point like it does in Xizang, or whether fruit flies they raised at home can be sent into space for experiments. The Shenzhou-13 crew took the questions patiently one by one. One of the most impressive experiments was the ""ice ball"" experiment. As taikonaut Wang Yaping showed, while the space station maintains a fixed ambient temperature at all times, she can transform water into ""ice"" with only a ""tap."" It turned out to be a crystallization effect caused by the micro-gravity environment in space.During the lecture, a ""mysterious guest"" also showed up at the space station - superstar Bing Dwen Dwen, the most-loved Olympic mascot at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. The comment section under the livestream exploded with excitement, as netizens said that they were so thrilled to see the panda that wears a space suit coming to space. ""Special assistant Professor Bing reporting from space!"" one netizen said. Another joked that ""judging from its figure, the chubby Bing Dwen Dwen definitely cannot pass the physical examination. But never mind, it can get special treatment for having such a huge fan base.""The livestream was broadcast by China Central Television, drawing a total of 3.3 million views and over 120 million likes. Although a number of countries have engaged in space lectures, only China and the US have realized the livestreaming of lectures with smooth two-way connections between Earth and space, Yang Yuguang, vice chairman of the Space Transportation Committee with the International Astronautical Federation, told the Global Times.For live classes, the most critical aspect is the ability to guarantee the uninterrupted two-way connection during a rather long period of time, and that would require the help of relay satellites, experts said. With Tianlian relay satellites at hand, China has achieved close to 100 percent coverage of the Earth, so there is no limitation on the length of the lectures, Yang explained.Elaborating on why space powers have been pursuing the practice over the past decades, observers said that it will not only promote people's understanding toward the values of manned spaceflight but more importantly, serve as an inspiration to youngsters and boost the country's talent reserve in the fields of science and technology. ""Unlike remote sensing satellites or communication and navigation satellites, which can bring direct benefits to people's lives and the national economy, manned space activities usually do not offer a direct economic return. Space lectures can promote the public understanding of the importance and values of manned space activities, and that's why China has taken space science popularization as one of the major functions of the Tiangong space station,"" Yang said. ""The space experiments stimulated the enthusiasm of our young people to devote themselves to the industry, and the significance of this activity has gone far beyond itself to cultivate successors for China's space industry,"" Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based member of the expert panel of China's first live space lecture, told the Global Times on Wednesday., achieved key experimental technology breakthroughs, and attained high-quality in-orbit test results and application data of the two large scientific research facilities - namely, the container-free material science laboratory cabinet and the high-microgravity science laboratory cabinet - onboard the country's orbital Tianhe core module, mission insiders told the Global Times previously in March.The Shenzhou-13 crew members are expected to complete their six-month record-long stay in orbit and return to Earth by April.The trio has completed more than 20 scientific experiments in orbit, conquering multiple world's firsts in China's Tianhe space station core module, Li Yinghui, deputy chief designer of the country's astronaut system, told CCTV on Wednesday.According to Li, the zero-gravity environment has facilitated human research on life science studies. The experiments the crew successfully carried out focused on new technology to monitor astronauts' wellbeing in space, innovation and new discoveries as well as data collection.The Shenzhou-13 crew, Li said, transformed renal epithelial cells from human urine into vigorous stem cells with multiple functions via genetic reprogramming, and these stem cells were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, which marked a world's first.The crew then edited a fluorescent protein to the cardiomyocytes through genetic modification, so that we could see the blinking of the calcium signal during contraction, which is also the first time in the world to see the beautiful cardiomyocytes in a weightless environment, Li noted.Li said these studies will give us a better understanding of how the weightless environment affects human beings, and also provide a great experimental model to contribute to the study of general public health issues such as aging and the occurrence of heart diseases. Chinese researchers also completed the world's first suspension culture experiment of skin stem cells under long-term weightlessness, thanks to the Shenzhou-13 crew and the country's space station, Li revealed, noting the study of cells will help us understand more about life.

Its power equaled to about 30 atomic bombs, which caused over 1,500 injuries and damaging over 3,000 houses. Russian authorities later confirmed a meteor had struck Russia and said it proved that the entire planet is vulnerable to meteors, and a space guard system is needed to protect the planet from similar objects in the future.Currently, the most practical measure to avoid such an impact is by hitting a threatening asteroid and change its original course, Li said. To achieve this, China will need a carrier rocket with exceptionally large thrust, and that would put China in the front line of the world's asteroid defense technology, experts said. The US is developing a Double Asteroid Redirection Test. Launched from Earth in November 2021, the mission will deliberately crash a space probe into the minor-planet moon Dimorphos of the double asteroid Didymos to assess the future potential of a spacecraft impact to deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.                          "

They have been carrying out tasks like closely monitoring weather conditions in the area and constructing systems for tracking and monitoring the flight of the spacecraft, read the latest posts by the Dongfeng site on its official WeChat public account.""Please rest assured, the well-geared and effectively trained ground and air units would be there once the return capsule touches down,"" the search and rescue teams said in one post.Ahead of the Shenzhou-13's return, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Thursday that Chinese President Xi Jinping, during an inspection tour on Tuesday in the Wenchang Space Launch Site located in South China's Hainan Province, demanded efforts to upgrade the spacecraft launch site in the island province with world-leading standards.Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site. He extended his greetings to all the staff stationed at the site and asked them to shoulder their responsibility and be brave to innovate and make new breakthroughs.After being briefed on the launch site, Xi inspected the launching tower and other facilities. He spoke highly of a series of key space missions launched from the site, including the launching of the space station core module Tianhe, the Chang'e-5 lunar mission, and the Tianwen-1 Mars probe.Xi noted that Wenchang is the launch site of China's new-generation high thrust carrier rockets and the bridgehead of the country's deep-space exploration.The launch site should continue to eye the frontier of global space development and the major strategic needs of China's space industry, and comprehensively improve its modern space launch capabilities, said Xi.Xi mentioned that Wenchang staff should carefully prepare, coordinate and implement the tasks to ensure the success of missions, and take practical actions to welcome the victory of the Party's 20th National Congress.As the youngest member of China's spacecraft launch centers, the Wenchang spaceport successfully completed its first launch mission on June 25, 2016, with the maiden flight of China's Long March-7 carrier rocket. On November 3, 2016, the Long March-5 also took its first flight from the launch site.Staff at the Wenchang spaceport reached by the Global Times said they were greatly encouraged and inspired by the speech from the top leader and vowed to ensure the success of future missions and contribute their wisdom and strength to making China a space power.Dubbed the ""home port for China's space station building missions,"" Wenchang was the launching site of the Tianhe core module, the Tianzhou-2 and the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecrafts on April 29, 2021, May 29, 2021, and September 20, 2021, respectively.On April 11, ahead of Xi's visit, the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft and the Long March-7 Y5 rocket commissioned for the launch mission arrived safely. The next launch is expected to be a third supply run to the Tianhe core module after the return of the crew of the Shenzhou-13.The Shenzhou-13 trio of taikonauts, under the command of Zhai Zhigang, was launched to space with a Long March-2F Y13 rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on October 16, 2021. They were scheduled to break the record of longest in-orbit stay for a single spaceflight mission in the country's space history. They have pulled that off.The length of stay and their physical and psychological condition in orbit have effectively verified the capability to stay in China's space station in the long term and this is another achievement that suggests China has become a strong space power, Song Zhongping, a space analyst and TV commentator, told the Global Times.The taikonauts of the Shenzhou-13 have conducted two successful spacewalks with Wang Yaping becoming the first Chinese woman in history to perform this maneuver.The crew also delivered two Tiangong Classroom science lectures for students on Earth, connecting with youth from Beijing, Hong Kong, Macao, and Xinjiang and Xizang autonomous regions.They have also played a significant part in many historic moments in China in the past six months, sending their greetings and congratulations during the Chinese New Year and joining the spectators of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games from space.The crew completed more than 20 scientific experiments in orbit, including those focused on new technologies to monitor the taikonauts' wellbeing in space, innovation, and new discoveries as well as data collection.These studies will give us a better understanding of how the weightless environment impacts human beings, and also provide a great experiment model to contribute to the study of general public health issues such as aging and heart diseases, said Li Yinghui, deputy chief designer of the country's taikonaut training system.Experts noted that six months is an international standard for the duration of stays. However, China is not competing and has never sought to compete with other space powers. As long as the station is properly attended to and the goal of the mission is met, the duration does not matter, and taikonauts can take shifts to allow more people in the candidate pool to have a chance, ensuring the health and safety of taikonauts in orbit, Song said.Pang Zhihao, a senior space expert, said the average length of orbital stay for the astronauts of the International Space Station is also about six months and China could reach this level as soon as in the second mission to the country's own space station, which is a great achievement.Analysts said the success of the first six-month mission has laid the foundation for future manned missions which would allow more room for imagination that amateur taikonauts, such as flight engineers, space scientists and even foreign astronauts would have no problem living and working in China's space station once it is fully completed.Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov recently said in an interview that China's space program is ""good and fast,"" and that China ""knows how to do things"" when it comes to manned spaceflights. He and his colleagues are willing to participate in China's space programs if China allows it, be they near-Earth orbit missions or deep-space explorations to the Moon and Mars.Shao Limin, deputy technology manager of manned spaceship systems, told the Global Times that the Shenzhou-13 spacecraft will fly five orbits before returning to Earth, which is 13 orbits less than the Shenzhou-12 mission. It will take about seven to eight hours.The fast-return technique requires little adjustment to the hardware and software of the spacecraft, but mainly making the flight control more compact, Shao said.""We have prepared a day for the return of the taikonauts. Although such duration meets the standards, a day of flight in the tight cabin is uncomfortable for them, especially after they have spent six months in space. We want our taikonauts to return in a shorter time. That is why we decided to adopt the fast return technique,"" Shao noted.Bai Linhou, deputy chief designer of China's space station, said in an interview that two experimental modules are expected to be launched in the second half of this year. The verification and assembly work of the modules is progressing smoothly.Both lab modules have a length of over 17 meters and a diameter of over 4 meters.The Wentian module is positioned to carry out space science experiments inside and outside the cabin. It has an airlock through which taikonauts can exit, and a small robotic arm which can be used alone or combined with the large mechanical arm of the space station.It can also serve as a backup to the core cabin, Bo said. If malfunction occurs in the core cabin, the Wentian module can replace it immediately, improving the reliability of the entire station's operation.The other lab module, the Mengtian, has a cargo airlock. The small robotic arm on the lab module can also grab payload via the airlock and install them onto the experiment platform outside the cabin.                         "

However, ""one third of the world's population is yet to see a single dose of vaccine, including 80 percent of the population of Africa […] And that compares to high income countries where 80 percent have received the vaccines,"" Gordon Brown, fundraising envoy of the World Health Organization (WHO) and former UK prime minister, said at the panel.""It is shocking that only 30 percent of healthcare workers and only 20 percent of the most vulnerable population, aged 60 or older, have been vaccinated in low income countries,"" said Brown.The chairman of Astra Zeneca, Leif Johansson, also said at the panel that while the production of vaccines has exceeded demand, the accessibility of vaccines remains a pressing issue that needs to be continuously addressed.As many at the forum recognized China's major contribution to fill the ""immunization gap,"" Deng Boqing, Vice Chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, remarked that China has provided more than 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations.In addition, China has also transferred technology and cooperated in the production of vaccines in more than 20 countries, building a production capacity of 1 billion doses overseas. In the next three years, China will provide $3 billion to support epidemic prevention and control work as well as the economic and social recovery in developing countries.China has also helped countries who lack the technical capacity to inoculate its population to achieve better vaccine efficacy.Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, former WHO Director-General, said that the world needs to help developing countries to build production capacity.""They want production capacity, not donations of money. That is not their ultimate goal. Their ultimate goal is being able to build their own health system, manage their health problems, and with the help of other countries, build their vaccine production capacity,"" she said.""China is doing its best, not only to protect its own people, but also to make a huge contributions,"" said Chan, adding that ""unfortunately, the window of opportunity created by China was lost by some countries.""In defiance of the ""immunization gap,"" guests at the panel called for further international cooperation. Brown said that changing the status quo requires advancement of vaccination programs on every continent, especially for people in low- and middle-income countries, and that relevant parties should provide these countries with all the equipment, facilities and supplies they need.China is willing to contribute to the issue of global vaccine accessibility together with developed countries, international organizations and the rest of the international community, Deng said.

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-04-19/cfc88a24-62a3-4a08-bba4-660a573b69d7.jpeg," A new study reported record low Antarctic sea-ice extent in February, showing for the first time the sea-ice extent in the Antarctic shrank to below 2 million square kilometers since 1978, the launch of satellite observations of the poles. The study, conducted by a group of researchers at Sun Yat-sen University and Southern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Zhuhai) in China, identified the contribution of dynamic and thermodynamic processes to the record low sea-ice extent. Their findings were published in the journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Tuesday.The extent of sea ice in the Arctic is undergoing rapid decline as a result of global warming, but at the Earth's other pole, Antarctic sea ice has been enjoying a modestly increasing trend of about one percent a decade since the late 1970s. But in 2017, the Southern hemisphere experienced a record minimum extent of sea ice. Then five years later, on February 25, a few days from the end of the Southern hemisphere's summer, scientists reported new record-low Antarctic sea ice extent of 1.9 million square kilometers. Yang Qinghua, co-author of the study and climatologist at Sun Yat-sen University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the Antarctic sea ice extent breaking the record again five years later may indicate that the Antarctic sea ice is experiencing extreme events more frequently. The loss of Antarctic sea ice may affect the weather and climate in high latitude regions, accelerate the melting and disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves, raise sea levels and destroy the Southern Ocean ecosystem of penguins, seals, krill and whales. However, Yang said that the current climate system models cannot well predict the exact future trend of Antarctic sea ice, and the record low sea ice extent might not necessarily indicate the Antarctic sea ice will witness a continued decline trend. The researchers found that in the summertime, it is the thermodynamics that dominates the processes that cause the melting of the sea ice. This occurs through anomalies in the transport of heat toward the pole in the Bellingshausen/Amundsen Seas, the western Pacific Ocean, and the eastern Weddell Sea in particular. But in the spring, both thermodynamics and dynamics contribute to the status of sea ice extent.In the study, scientists revealed how thermodynamics and dynamics affect the change of sea ice in the summer and spring of the Southern Hemisphere, providing a reference for further study and prediction of sea ice change in the Antarctic although the current preliminary study cannot systematically explain the sea ice change, Yang said.

The specimen is close to the northern hawk owl,  a medium-sized owl of the northern latitudes, non-migratory and diurnal. The extinct owl belongs to clade Surniini which contains most living diurnal owl species.A comparison of sclera bones of the Miocene owl and 55 reptiles and 360 birds, including many owls, showed the ancient bird's eyes are less open to light and enable it to see things clear during the day, according to a statement by the institute.Paleotologists found the newly identified diurnal owl lived around 6 million years ago in the late Miocene period. The discovery was published on Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) on Monday. Phylogenetically constrained character mapping coincides with a reconstruction of the owl group's early evolutionary reversal away from nocturnal habits. The findings support a potential Miocene origin of nonnocturnal habits in a globally distributed owl group, which may be linked to steppe habitat expansion and climatic cooling in the late Miocene, according to the study. The fossil and associated analyses of the eye and behavioral evolution also point to a long evolutionary history of nonnocturnal behavior among owls that has yet to be studied in detail.

He spoke highly of a series of key space missions launched from the site, including the launch of the space station's core module, the Tianhe, the Chang'e-5 lunar mission and the Tianwen-1 Mars probe.Xi noted that Wenchang is the launch site for China's new-generation of high-thrust carrier rockets and the bridgehead of the country's deep-space exploration.Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's Tianwen-1 Mars probe, Wang Yaping, the star-picking mom and a member of the just-returned Shenzhou-13 mission crew, and Shan Jixiang, former curator of the Palace Museum, were named as ambassadors for China's space industry.The United Nations Under-Secretary-General Atul Khare, Director General of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites Phil Evans, Russia's space agency Roscosmos Director Dmitry Rogozin, and officials with Pakistan's space agency Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission sent congratulations to China for Space Day on Sunday.China successfully conducted 55 orbital launches in 2021, and China will further advance its pursuit of space dreams, planning more than 60 launches in 2022, Wu Yanhua, deputy head of the China National Space Administration (CNSA,) told the Global Times on the sidelines of the event.The 2022 launch schedule includes six for the in-orbit building of the country's first space station including launches for the Tianzhou-4, Tianzhou-5 cargo spacecraft and Wentian and Mengtian laboratory modules. China plans to launch space infrastructure satellites including the Gaofen-01A remote sensing satellite as well as ones tasked for environment monitoring services, per the CNSA deputy head. Wu revealed that China will officially launch research and studies for its Phase-4 lunar explorations, including the launches of the Chang'e-6, -7, and -8 probes to the moon, during which work on tackling key technology issues and those related to the construction of the China-Russia proposed International Lunar Research Station (ILRS) would be carried out. Chang'e-6 is planned as a lunar sampling and return mission from the dark side of moon and China will invest in efforts in the proposition of building a satellite constellation around the moon with the functions of both communication and navigation in space.  Chang'e-7 will probe the lunar polar region, especially looking into water distribution on the moon. These two missions will be launched around 2025, during which the development for the Chang'e-8 mission will start simultaneously, Liu Jizhong, director of the China Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering Center, said during a press conference in January with the release of the long-anticipated fifth edition of a new white paper, titled China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective.China's Chang'e-7 mission includes an agreement with Russia's Luna-26 mission, and the two sides will explore the moon together, Liu said.Chang'e-8's launch, according to Liu, could be expected before 2030, and would involve verifying key technology for the lunar station.Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based senior space expert, predicted that to meet such requirements, multiple relay satellites with communication and navigation functions would be launched into lunar orbit. They are to support the future Long March-8 carrier rocket for the building of the ILRS.China, in the next five years, plans to complete key technology work for major missions such as an asteroid probe and a Mars sampling and return missions. The development of a heavy-lift carrier rocket and a new-generation manned launch vehicle will also be carried out in this period. China is also planning to explore the edges of the solar system and other more distant space in the long term, including sample retrieval from Mercury, and probing Jupiter's satellite moons, Wu added. Wu stressed that China's space exploration would always adhere to the principle of joint consultation, joint construction and sharing, with an emphasis on openness and win-win purpose, and always be devoted to the building of a shared future of mankind in space. To practice these principles, Wu told the Global Times that China is eyeing building a system for near-Earth asteroid defense, organizing the drafting of development plans and developing near-Earth small celestial body defense simulation software. ""It is to contribute China's wisdom to the human beings' joint response to the threat of small near-Earth objects, taking on the responsibility of a great country and safeguarding the safety of Earth and peaceful development of humanity together with other countries,"" Wu underscored. A ground-based and space-based monitoring and warning system for asteroids will be set up to catalog and analyze asteroids that pose a threat to humanity's space activities, and then relevant technology and engineering will be developed to dispel the threats. China will hopefully carry out a technical experiment as early as 2025 on a threatening asteroid by closely tracking and attacking it to change its orbit, Wu disclosed on Sunday. Mission insiders revealed to the Global Times on Sunday that the system is currently at the project establishment phase and being reviewed for approval, which involves the close coordination of multiple departments.Song Zhongping, a military expert and space observer, told the Global Times on Sunday that currently the US and Russia are also building asteroid monitoring systems, and China's defense system could be an important supplement in addressing the threats of asteroids hitting Earth.""This is another practical solution that China proposes to build a community with a shared future for mankind, and it is the duty for a major space power to protect mankind from possible disasters that could end the entire human civilization,"" Song said.  The latest asteroid impact incident happened in 2013 in Russia's Chelyabinsk, when an approximately 18 meter-diameter near-Earth asteroid entered the atmosphere and exploded 30 kilometers above the ground. Its power equaled to about 30 atomic bombs, which caused over 1,500 injuries and damaging over 3,000 houses.                         "

The team's latest paper, ""Protective prototype-Beta and Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer vaccines against SARS-CoV-2,"" was included in Cell, a top-ranking biology journal on Tuesday.The researchers previously developed the protein subunit vaccine ZF2001 based on dimeric receptor-binding domain (RBD) of prototype SARS-CoV-2. In the latest study, the team developed a chimeric RBD-dimer vaccine approach to adapt to SARS-CoV-2 variants.A prototype-Beta chimeric RBD-dimer was first designed to adapt to the resistant Beta variant. Compared with its homotypic forms, the chimeric vaccine elicited broader sera neutralization of variants and conferred better protection in mice. The protection of the chimeric vaccine was further verified in macaques, according to the researchers.This approach was generalized to develop a Delta-Omicron chimeric RBD-dimer to adapt to the currently prevalent variants. The vaccine conferred better protection against either Delta or Omicron SARS-CoV-2 in mice.As breakthrough infections by COVID-19 variants become the global challenge for pandemic control, the chimeric approach is applicable for rapid updating of immunogens. The data supported the use of variant-adapted multivalent vaccine against circulating and emerging variants, the researchers say.Previously, ZF2001, the world's first approved COVID-19 protein subunit vaccine, was developed and produced from a pre-design concept developed by Gao Fu's team and approved for emergency use in China, Uzbekistan, Indonesia and Colombia.Recently, vaccine studies by other Chinese research teams have also caught the attention of the international academic community. A circular RNA vaccine reported by Wei Wensheng's team at the Peking University and a nanoparticle vaccine by Zhang Hui's team at the Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences, have both shown to be effective against Omicron in laboratory trials.Their studies are believed to play a key role in technology leadership in future vaccine development, observers noted.

At 2:23 am, the solar panels onboard the spacecraft smoothly unfolded, with all functions in normal operating condition, marking the success of the third launch of a spaceship to the space station core cabin, according to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA.)Mission insiders revealed to the Global Times on the sideline of the launch mission that it would take merely about six and a half hours after launch for the spacecraft to conduct fast rendezvous and docking with the Tianhe core module's rear port, which is similar to the Tianzhou-3 mission in September 2021.According to the spacecraft developer, the China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST), Tianzhou-4 carries more than 200 parcels of cargo weighing some 6.2 tons in the delivery run, supplying the astronauts, space station systems and space application domains. Propellants of 750 kilograms are also onboard.Those supplies would ensure the smooth implementation of following missions such as another six-month stay of three taikonauts - the Shenzhou-14 mission, the in-orbit construction and assembly of the China Space Station as well as scientific projects of a range of disciplines such as material science and space medicine, according to the CAST.It is also worth noting that the Tianzhou-4 craft also possesses capabilities of controlling the space station's flight form and flying orbit, providing remote monitoring and data transmission services to the space station as well as supporting in-orbit science experiments.Being a fully-sealed spacecraft, Tianzhou-4 is by far the world's largest in-service cargo spaceship with the most comprehensive in-orbit support capability, the CAST noted.The CAST also made improvements to the craft based on suggestions from taikonauts who have visited the space station. For example, to facilitate taikonauts searching for goods in-orbit, Tianzhou-4 has added labeling design and applied colors to packages' handles.Dang Rong, deputy chief designer of the craft, told the Global Times that Tianzhou-4 also carried payload for special experiments and would release a satellite as part of the process.It would be the fourth time that the 53.1-meter-long, 3.35-meter-diameter Long March-7 rocket carried its Tianzhou passengers to space. Having established perfect coordination between the two space buddies, the rocket's flight reliability assessment value has reached 0.9838, an internationally advanced level, indicating a stabilized overall technical status of the rocket.For this mission, the first run to China's space station core module this year, the rocket has made 17 technical upgrades, optimizing pre-launch processes, shortening preparation time, and reducing the requirements for personnel, equipment, weather and other conditions.Through the slew of changes, the rocket's test and launch cycle has been reduced by 4 days, from 31 days to 27 days. This is also the first time that a Long March-7 rocket has been tested and launched within one month.The Tuesday mission marked the first of the six space station-building-tasked launch missions in 2022 by the end of which China Space Station would complete construction and become operational.With 2022 marking the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the country's manned space engineering project, the completion of Tiangong is a key target of the three-step strategy for the project, and an important symbol of China becoming a strong space power in the world, Hao Chun, the director of the CMSA revealed at a press conference following the triumph return of Shenzhou-13 crew by mid-April.The six flights are the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft, another supply run for the next shift, launched today; the Shenzhou-14 manned mission in June; the Wentian experimental module in July; the Mengtian experimental module in October; another cargo mission, the Tianzhou-5, and a manned mission, the Shenzhou-15.The Shenzhou-14 and -15 manned missions, which will each carry a crew of three members, will meet and stay together in the station for about five to 10 days when the two crews rotate, said Huang Weifen, head of taikonauts training system at the same press conference. It means that China's space station will have, for the first time, six taikonauts staying in orbit at the same time, testing the station's maximum capacity for human stays in the short term.Next year, China plans to launch its first large-scale telescope called Xuntian, or ""survey the heavens."" It will have a 2-meter diameter lens, which according to space.com, a professional news website covering space activities around the world, makes it ""comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope,"" only boasting a field of view 300 times greater than that of the 31-year-old Hubble while retaining a similar resolution.On international collaboration over the China Space Station, Wang Wenbin, said during a routine press conference on April 18 that since the inception and implementation of the China manned space engineering program, China has followed the principles of peaceful use, equality, mutual benefit and common development. It signed cooperation agreements and carried out cooperation projects in various forms with France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and many space agencies or organizations including the UN Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) and the European Space Agency, with fruitful outcomes.""The China Space Station is the first of its kind, being open to all UN member states. So far nine projects from 17 countries and 23 entities have been included in the first batch of selected projects for the China Space Station science experiment. At present, we are working on the first batch of international cooperation projects for China Space Station in collaboration with UNOOSA, which hopefully will see the beginning of experiment and research in space at the end of this year,"" the spokesperson revealed.Foreign astronauts are welcome to visit the China Space Station and join Chinese astronauts in making more positive contributions to exploring the universe and building a community with a shared future for mankind, Wang announced.

The way the light bends around the dark center, known as the event horizon, shows the object's powerful gravity which is 4 million times that of our sun, according to a report from The Harvard Gazette.The new picture provides the first direct visual evidence that the giant, lurking 27,000 light-years away at the center of Earth's galaxy is, in fact a supermassive black hole. It also bolsters theories of where these cosmic monsters exist and may help to explain how galaxies are formed, read the report.Under the coordination of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory (SAO), Chinese astronomers attended a preliminary study of the observation and analysis of observation data, the Shanghai government announced on Thursday.The Tian Ma 65m radio-telescope of the SAO, one of the world's biggest and most powerful, participated in the observations.Shen Zhiqiang, director of the SAO, told media that the future objective of the EHT is to get video images of the black hole at the center of the Milky Way. He also revealed that China is planning to build submillimeter wave very-long-baseline interferometry telescopes to participate in the observation of Sgr A* around the clock.Black holes are extraordinarily dense objects with gravity so strong that not even light can escape, making viewing them extremely challenging. A black hole's event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything, including stars, planets, gas, dust and all forms of electromagnetic radiation, gets dragged into oblivion, according to a report by Reuters.""This is our supermassive black hole,"" said Peter Galison, director of Harvard's Black Hole Initiative, a member of the EHT team, and the Joseph Pellegrino University Professor in the History of Science and Physics. ""This is at the center of where we live,"" Galison was quoted as saying in the report by The Harvard Gazette.                         "

Photo:XinhuaThe first clinical research of China's antiviral oral drug against SARS-CoV-2, VV116, was published on Tuesday. The study shows the drug can effectively treat patients infected with the Omicron variant with mild symptoms in the early stages.The study was conducted in March and included 136 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 60 in the VV116 group and 76 in the control group. And the results showed that the VV116 group spent at average of 8.56 days to test negative for COVID-19, while the time for the control group was 11.13 days.No adverse reactions were observed within those who took VV116, the study shows.The paper was published by the Emerging Microbes & Infections journal, by scientists from Fudan University's Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and other institutes. Zhang Wenhong, head of the infectious disease department at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, and also head of the National Center for Infectious Disease under the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, co-authored the article.Since the article only included patients with mild symptoms, it doesn't have enough data to show the drug's effect on patients with severe symptoms, the study pointed out.According to industrial analysis, 21 domestic COVID-19 drugs is undergoing research and development in China, among them six reached phase III clinical trials.The VV116, an oral anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleoside candidate jointly developed by the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is one of the most focused candidates.

The Tianzhou-2 mission, which was the first supply run heading toward the space station, detached from the core module about a month ago after accomplishing its mission.According to the spacecraft developer, the China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST), the Tianzhou-4 carries more than 200 parcels of cargo weighing some 6.2 tons, supplying the astronauts, space station systems and space application domains. Propellants of 750 kilograms are also onboard.It also possesses capabilities of controlling the space station's flight form and orbit, providing remote monitoring and data transmission services to the space station as well as supporting in-orbit science experiments.Tianzhou-4's journey to space and its docking operations have been secured by a ""sky road"" established by the ""handshake"" of a relay terminal and satellites, the CAST told the Global Times. By establishing a space-based telecommunications system, the relay terminal can simultaneously ""remote pilot"" the Tianzhou-3, Tianzhou-4 and the Tianhe core module, transmit data such as images of rendezvous and docking to the ground in real time, and provide communications support for the entire process. Once the telecommunication link is established, the ground's control and monitor coverage rate of the Tianzhou-4 will be improved by more than 90 percent, ensuring that the craft can stay in touch with the ground most of the time, CAST revealed. The Tianzhou supply series has experienced a significant reduction of rendezvous and docking time over the years. The first Tianzhou mission, launched and docked with the Tiangong-2 in 2017, took about two days. The second mission last May took a mere eight hours to achieve the feat.                          "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-06-05/ce43b381-ad4f-4cd7-b79f-071fc4f2c16b.jpeg," China's Tianhe space station core module and Tianzhou-3, -4 cargo spacecraft combination have received a new crew of taikonauts, some 10 hours after the mission was launched from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China's Gansu Province on Sunday.The Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft docked with the radial port of Tianhe space station core module at 5:17 pm Sunday, and the trio of taikonauts entered the Tianhe space station core module at around 8:50 pm, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement sent to the Global Times.The new combination flight consists of the Tianhe core module at the center, the Shenzhou-14 manned craft at the bottom, and Tianzhou-3 and -4 cargo craft on the side.Sitting atop the Long March-2F Y14 carrier rocket and carrying three taikonauts - the third crew group to enter China's Tianhe space station core module - the Shenzhou-14 was launched at 10:44 am on Sunday, amid sweaty palms and pounding hearts of millions of thrilled stargazers across the world.After a flight of around 577 seconds, the Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft separated from the rocket to enter its designated orbit, with the crew onboard in good condition, marking a full success of the launch mission, the Global Times learned from the CMSA.The Shenzhou-14 marks the first crewed spaceflight mission to the Tianhe at the China Space Station in-orbit assembly stage.The Wentian and Mengtian space station lab modules, the Tianzhou-5 cargo spacecraft, and the Shenzhou-15 manned spacecraft are expected to be launched during the Shenzhou-14 crew's six-month stay in orbit. This will be a record for the crewed Tianhe, as during the two previous crewed missions, there were not so many launches.The space station combination would also see the simultaneous stay of six taikonauts in orbit, and as the Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 crew members are expected to conduct their rotation in orbit for about a week, which would be another breakthrough in China's manned spaceflight history.Senior Colonel Chen Dong, 44, is a veteran taikonaut who visited space in China's Shenzhou-11 manned space mission in 2016 and set the previous record for the longest stay in space by a Chinese spacefarer at 33 days for his stay on the Tiangong-2 space lab.The record was broken by Shenzhou-13 taikonaut Wang Yaping in 2022, and Chen would be able to surpass that with another 180 days in space in the Shenzhou-14 run.Senior Colonel Liu Yang, a 44-year-old female crew member joining Shenzhou-14 previously went to space in 2012 on the Shenzhou-9 mission and was the first Chinese woman to do so. At a press conference on Sunday, she said that for the upcoming six-month mission, she and her crewmates are looking forward to celebrating for the first time the birthday of their motherland on October 1 as well as the Mid-Autumn Festival, a holiday for the reunion and gathering of the Chinese people. This year's Mid-Autumn Festival falls on September 10.Senior Colonel Cai Xuzhe, 46, is making his maiden space voyage during the upcoming mission. ""For this day, I have prepared 12 years. I feel honored and proud to have this chance to go into space for my country,"" he said.The Shenzhou-14 crew are members of the second cohort of taikonauts China has trained.Commenting on the younger lineup in which the older, first group of veterans are not included, Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based senior space expert said that the new Shenzhou taikonaut trio must have showed outstanding performance during training, and the younger crew members have mastered new knowledge and skills for the mission.Pang told the Global Times that the Shenzhou-14 crew is still made up of two veterans and one newcomer just like the Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-13 missions. The younger crew members would have better stamina and could deliver on more complicated tasks such as the installation and testing of the two lab modules.Mission commander Chen said at the press conference on Saturday, ""Our crew are relatively young, but we have full preparation, fiery passion, and strong confidence. With 12 years of living together and 2.5 years of mission training, we have grown more and more familiar with each other, and our minds, actions, and aims are united. Although I have shouldered the pressure, there is also more confidence and determination to complete this task.""The trio is slated to carry out the verification of big and small robotic arms, spacewalks, and the construction of payload outside the cabin, the Global Times learned from the Shenzhou spacecraft developer with the state-owned aerospace contractor China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC.)The Shenzou-14 crew's stay in orbit will see nine modifications of the space station combination, with five rendezvous and dockings, three separations and two module relocations, which makes it the most complicated in-orbit mission to date, Guo Zhi, a senior engineer with the Xi'an Satellite Control Center, told the Global Times on Sunday.The center vowed to continue to update its computing system, optimize its orbit calculation mode, and combining ground station, space-borne monitoring technology as well as data from China's home developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) to ensure the successful execution of the mission.Like during the previous missions, the Shenzhou-14 crew will give Tiangong classes to earthbound youngsters, and will for the first time use the airlock cabin in the Wentian module to exit the station for extravehicular activities. These activities will be scheduled two to three times during their stay, the Global Times has learned.The basic structure of the space station will be completed during this mission, consisting of the Tianhe core cabin and the two lab modules - the Wentian expected in July and Mengtian in October. The Wentian module along with the Long March-5B Y3 carrier rocket has already been transported to the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on May 29 for assembly and testing, announced the CMSA.Upon completion, China will establish a national space laboratory.The laboratory will contain 25 cabinets for a variety of scientific experiments, each of which can function as an individual lab, reaching an overall international advanced level, Lin Xiqiang, deputy head of the CMSA Engineering Office, told the Global Times.The Wentian lab will mainly focus on the study of space life sciences, which can support the growth, development, genetics and aging of multiple species of plants, animals and microorganisms under space conditions.The Mengtian lab will be oriented to microgravity scientific researches and is equipped with experimental cabinets for fluid physics, materials science, combustion science, basic physics and space technology experiments.Later, a space telescope research facility, the Xuntian telescope, will launch into orbit and fly with the space station to carry out wide-area survey observations.Another highlight for the Shenzhou-14 mission is the maneuvering of a small robotic arm installed on the Wentian module. Compared with the large robotic arm which was launched into space with the Tianhe core cabin, the small one is more compact, Lin noted.The weight and length of the small robotic arm are about half of the large one, and the load capacity is about one-eighth of the large arm. It also has a more flexible movement and manipulation than the large arm.The small robotic arm has a higher positioning accuracy, with its positioning precision five times better than the large arm, and altitude control twice as precise. Therefore it can complete more fine operations.What's more, the small and large robotic arms can coordinate with each other to cover wider scopes of work outside the cabin, and the combination is capable of achieving a greater variety of tasks.The most complex in-orbit mission has brought with it greater challenges, not only from the heavier tasks but the impact of epidemic. Lin told the Global Times that the challenge was particularly grave as many regions in China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Changchun, were overshadowed by Omicron.However, they have beaten all the odds to ensure each step in the aerospace system is steady and safe. To guarantee staff members in the system, especially the taikonauts, do not get infected, they have followed the strictest anti-epidemic rules to the highest standard. Since March, all taikonauts were under strict closed-cycle management to safeguard their training program.The Shenzhou-13 mission safely returned back to Earth on April 16 in a historic feat, thus concluding the technology verification stage of China's space station. The three crew members - Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping, and Ye Guangfu - completed their quarantine smoothly with cardiopulmonary functions and other body indicators recovering to their pre-flight levels.They are currently in the second phase of recovery that focuses on muscle and bone recovery. In general, the three taikonauts are in good physical and mental condition, and the recovery of various physiological and psychological indicators is in line with expectations, the Global Times has learned.

Aderholt was reportedly referring to the ""jarring similarities"" that were noticed between the US and Chinese spacecrafts, US media reported on Wednesday.The NASA chief responded that ""they [the Chinese] are pretty good at stealing,"" and emphasized that the US needs to take cybersecurity ""very seriously"" both in the private and the public sectors.In April, Nelson accused China of continuing to display a lack of transparency and willingness to cooperate with the US and other countries in space. He said in a press conference at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida that ""we want cooperation that has not been forthcoming from the Chinese government [but] it takes two to tango.""According to US media, Bill Nelson and other politicians discussed during a hearing on Monday President Joe Biden's request for $26 billion in fiscal year 2023, an unprecedented amount. Nelson told lawmakers that China plans to send three large landers to the moon's south pole in upcoming years, while NASA currently has only a small lander headed to the same region in the next two years.""They now have a space station and it's got impressive technology,'' Nelson said. ""They have declared that they are going to the moon. …Not unlike the space race we were in with the Soviet Union, I think we are going to have that space race with the Chinese government in the future.''Deng Yulin, an academician of the International Academy of Astronautics, told the Global Times on Thursday that China's space development program is aimed at the peaceful use of space and promote a community with a shared future for mankind, which is completely different from the US-Soviet Union space race that was mainly for military purposes.""Nelson plays up the notion of a space race between China and the US for the purpose of taking money from the government. It also shows that the US is feeling great pressure from the rapid pace of China's space development,"" Deng said.Huang Zhicheng, a senior expert on aerospace science and technology, said the allegation of NASA's chief is not only unreasonable, but also certain to be laughed at by history.The space technologies of all countries in the world are subject to the same basic scientific principles and development laws. In recent years, China has made remarkable achievements in the BeiDou Global Navigation Satellite System, high-resolution Earth observation and remote sensing satellite system, Moon and Mars exploration, and manned spaceflight but China's space development path is completely different from that of the US.""For example, the Chang'e-4 landed on the far side of the moon to carry out exploration tasks and China's first mission to Mars are the paths that Americans have never achieved,"" Huang said.The expert said the US has always maintained a strong blockade on China's space industry. From the Cox Report to the Wolf Amendment, there have been no normal space exchanges between China and the US. Under such circumstances, it is well known that China has independently developed space technology and trailblazing its own development path, which has been recognized and praised by space scholars around the world.""I hope NASA can change its past practices, put down its arrogance and offer some constructive suggestions for China-US space cooperation,"" Huang said.Deng also believes that Bill Nelson's false accusation exposed this NASA chief is showing ""double standards.""Deng pointed out that the development of science and technology and social progress is based on the achievements of predecessors and step by step advancement, which is why research results need to be published in paper and intellectual property rights need to be open. All these will promote the development of social progress.""According to Nielsen's logic, American scientists are also quoting a large number of papers by Chinese scientists and using Chinese invention patents for reference. Does this mean that Americans are stealing Chinese research achievements? Scientists all over the world are quoting from each other. Does that mean everyone is stealing from each other?"" Deng asked.As a matter of fact, rockets, spacecrafts, satellites and other spaceships developed by China are the product of large number of independent intellectual property rights with their relevant patents. In some respects, China even leads the world. Intellectual property has clear claims and Bill Nelson's generalization of intellectual property protection claims is ridiculous and outrageous, Deng said.                         "

This marked the first time in the world a deorbiting sail system has been deployed in such a way, the Global Times learned from the system developers on Tuesday.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-06-26/b5d764af-76c0-47c7-a20c-9ddf41e09485.jpeg," China has made new strides forward in managing space junk, as it has successfully unfolded a 25-square-meter deorbiting sail in-orbit for the payload capsule of a recently launched rocket. This marked the first time in the world a deorbiting sail system has been deployed in such a way, the Global Times learned from the system developers on Tuesday.The deorbiting sail device, developed by Institute 805 of the Shanghai Academy of Spacecraft Technology (SAST) is designed to enable dysfunctional spacecraft to leave orbit sooner in order to help control the spread of space debris and junk. The sail was installed on the payload capsule of the Long March-2D Y64 carrier rocket that was launched into space on June 23 and the system was successfully unfolded in orbit on June 26, according to the SAST.The sail system stretches to 25 square meters, according to the SAST developers, and can enable a 300-kilogram payload capsule to re-enter Earth's atmosphere within two years, so as to release precious orbital resources.The size of the deorbiting sail also set a record, the developers revealed.The sail is made of extra-thin materials and its thickness is less than one tenth of the diameter of a hair. Such light, highly extendable textiles mean that the sail system can be installed onboard any mature spacecraft, according to the SAST.The SAST explained to the Global Times that the deorbiting sail system is like a gigantic kite in space that can help slow down spacecraft once deployed.The thin sail uses aerodynamic resistance formed by the thin atmosphere of the low-orbit environment to slowly decelerate the satellite and gradually leave the original orbit, the SAST said, explaining the working principles of the system.Taking a small satellite with an orbit altitude of 750 kilometers and a weight of 15 kilograms as an example, it can continue to operate in orbit for 120 years and even longer after the end of its service life if no deorbiting measures are taken. The use of the 2.25-square-meter deorbiting sail can reduce the deorbiting time of satellites to less than 10 years.China tested a similar passive deorbiting 2.25-square-meter deorbiting sail system codenamed Taurus for the first time in September 2019.Space junk poses a threat to in-orbit spacecraft. The most typical case is the crash between the US' ""Iridium 33"" and the scrapped ""Cosmos-2251"" of the Soviet Union at a height of nearly 800 kilometers above Siberia.The crash not only knocked out Iridium 33 but also produced a large amount of debris, which was scattered across more than a thousand kilometers in space, having a big impact on subsequent space programs.

The discovery provides important evidence of the presence of impact ejecta near the craters in the sampling area of Chang'e-5, which was previously determined through the analysis of remote sensing data.Chinese researchers from the Institute of Geochemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences found for the first time fragments of seifertite and stishovite, minerals formed from silicon dioxide at high temperatures and pressures, in the samples of lunar regolith. The sample also contained silicon dioxide and silica glass. This marks the first time for seifertite to be found in the samples from outside the Earth.Meteorite impact is an important geological process for the combination of materials on the lunar surface, which serves an important factor for controlling the formation and evolution of lunar soil.The high-pressure minerals formed after meteorite impacts are an important evidence of the process and determine the temperature and pressure of the rocks during the impact and infer the size of the impact crater.However, high-pressure minerals have been rarely found in lunar samples and lunar meteorites limiting the research of lunar surface impacts from lunar samples.The fragment of silicon dioxide in the sample recorded the pressure and subsequent heat and depressurization of a lunar impact event.By simulating the temperature and pressure for the formation of the fragment under impact conditions, it was determined that the silicon dioxide debris may have come from the Aristarchus impact crater in the Chang 'e-5 sampling area.

One very important process in binary evolution is called common envelope evolution, which profoundly affects the outcome of binary evolution, Zhao Gang, a research fellow at the National Astronomical Observatories of Chinese Academy of Sciences, explained. Common envelopes were first postulated in 1976, and have been widely used as the explanation for the formation of double black holes, double neutron stars, double white dwarfs and many other compact binaries. However, until this day, a common envelope has never been seen yet, which has made it difficult to understand the physical processes that actually occurred during this evolutionary phase.""The latest study of the binary system, which has just completed a common envelope ejection, is the very link that has been missing from the observations,"" Zhao said, noting that it is a groundbreaking discovery from zero to one, which has made it possible to study the formation and evolution of close binary systems by restoring their early physical status. ""The significance of this discovery is that it turns a theoretical idea into reality. Scientists have not only seen the first observational evidence of the evolution of a common envelope of binary systems, but they have also been able to accurately characterize this key process through observations. This is a milestone discovery in the field, where scientists have previously been able to describe the process only in broad terms, without precise numerical simulations and without direct observational evidence,"" said the statement YNO sent to the Global Times. ""It is great to see this collaboration between Australian and Chinese Astronomers yield such an exciting result. I am pleased to have visited China many times and witnessed the growth of Chinese astronomy. I wish all the best for Chinese Astronomy, and continued productive collaborations,"" noted Brian Schmidt, Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University and the winner of 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Science,By Zhang Hui   |  2022/6/8 23:19:53,China's radio telescope detects first persistently active repeating fast radio burst from 3b light years away,"An international team led by Chinese scientists discovered and located the first persistently active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with the help of the world's largest radio telescope, China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), which indicated the evolution of FRBs and may help scientists understand the origin of the brightest radio waves emanating from billions of light years outside the galaxy.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-06-06/747bd952-5e7f-4fdf-b6a8-af99966702a3.jpeg," An international team led by Chinese scientists discovered and located the first persistently active repeating fast radio burst (FRB) with the help of the world's largest radio telescope, China's Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), which indicated the evolution of FRBs and may help scientists understand the origin of the brightest radio waves emanating from billions of light years outside the galaxy. The new FRB, named FRB190520B, was discovered in a metal-poor dwarf galaxy 3 billion light years away. The initial discovery was made by Niu Chenhui, a research fellow from the National Astronomical Observatories of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC) through FAST from May 20, 2019. Then Law Casey, a scientist with the California Institute of Technology who led a Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) program located the FRB190520B in July 2020. The study led by chief scientist of FAST Li Di and titled ""a repeating fast radio burst associated with a persistent radio source"" was published in  on Wednesday. FRBs are mysterious radio flashes lasting milliseconds from deep space, but little is known about their origin although some scientists suggest that they could be evidence of advanced alien life. So far, less than 5 percent of all the hundreds of FRBs detected have been seen to repeat. Only a few are active and only the newly discovered FRB190520B is persistently active, thus providing precious glances into their secrets.The FRB190520B has the highest ambient electron density of all FRBs and shows reliable bursting behaviors which can be detectable every month. Four bursts were detected during the initial 24 seconds. The characteristics of FRB190520B indicated that it may be a ""newborn."" This discovery hints at an evolutionary picture of FRBs, according to the team. Niu said FRB190520B is the first repeating FRB detected by FAST, and is only the second repeating FRB with a compact persistent radio source after discovery of the first repeater FRB121102A by US Arecibo Radio Telescope in 2016.Niu told the Global Times that FRB190520B's behavior is similar to FRB121102A, but it's just more extreme as it is persistently active and has a more complex electromagnetic environment. ""We further postulate that FRB121102A and FRB190520B represent the initial stage of an evolving FRB population. A coherent picture of the origin and evolution of FRBs is likely to emerge in just a few years,"" said Li. Duncan Lorimer, a professor at West Virginia University who discovered the first FRB, commented on the new finding of the FAST that it suggested the FRB phenomenon in general is likely due to a number of source populations, and further results that are anticipated in the coming years as the FRB sample continue to grow will allow us to elucidate the details of this intriguing population, according to NAOC. Collaborative research is increasingly significant in astronomy and the location of FRB190520B was conducted with the help of American scientists and equipment despite US government's growing efforts in pushing for a technology and supply chain decoupling from China. Li said that astronomy is a common pursuit of all mankind and FAST is used by international scientists from regions including the US, Europe and Australia. At Monday's press conference, Hou Jianguo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that so far FAST has provided observation time for 27 international projects from 14 countries. After the initial posting of the new discovery, more in-depth analysis and modeling for this source have been published, including a polarization analysis, scattering timescale models and supernova origin models, NAOC said.                          "

Working together, they are expected to carry out high-definition observation of asteroids within 150 million kilometers, the Global Times learned from the project lead, the Beijing Institute of Technology.The Beijing Institute of Technology Chongqing innovation center, China's National Astronomical Observatories under the China Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University and Peking University will also join the Fuyan construction process, which will become the world's most far-reaching radar system. Long Teng, President of the Beijing Institute of Technology, who is also a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in a statement the university provided to the Global Times that as the system comprises multiple antennas, just like the facetted eyes of the insect, we give it a vivid name, China Fuyan. Long said that the construction will fill in blank space and meet the country's requirements including near-Earth defense and space sensing capability, as well as frontier studies on Earth habitability and the formation of asteroids. The Fuyan program comes following China's announcement in April of plans to build a near-Earth asteroid monitoring and defense system to deal with the threat of asteroids impacting spacecraft, and contribute to protecting the safety of the Earth and the human race.A ground-based and space-based  will be set up to catalog and analyze asteroids that potentially pose a threat to human space activities. Technology and engineering will be developed to dispel these threats.The new radar facility in Chongqing will also support the country's quests of probing the territory between the Earth and the Moon, including searching for a proper landing target for the Tianwen-2 probe mission, the Global Times learned from the Beijing Institute of Technology.Zhang Rongqiao, the chief designer of Tianwen-1 Mars probe mission, revealed to the media in May that Tianwen-2 has entered its prototype research and development stage, and it is expected to be launched by 2025. Tianwen-2 will be a decade long mission, during which the probe will carry out observations as well as returning samples from near-Earth asteroid 2016HO3. According to Space.com, the target asteroid is also named Kamo'oalewa, which may actually be a blasted-off piece of Earth's moon.According to Long, the program will be proceeding in three-stages. Four pieces of 16-meter-diameter radar will be set up to verify the feasibility of such system and achieve a 3D image render of the Moon.Currently, two of the four radars have been constructed in Chongqing, and they are expected to become operational by September this year. The second stage will be increasing the number of antenna to more than 20 and form a high-definition distributed radar system equivalent to one with 100 meter diameter, enabling the country to probe and image asteroid some tens of millions kilometers away and to verify relevant technology. The third stage will eventually realize the 150 million kilometer observation capability and become the world's first deep-space radar to have the capability to carry out 3D imaging and dynamic monitoring as well as active observation to celestial bodies throughout the inner solar system. The Beijing Institute of Technology's Chongqing innovation center told the Global Times on Sunday that the schedule and scale of the third stage is yet to be determined, as those decisions would be made based on results and studies run during the previous stages.Space experts contacted by the Global Times on Sunday said that different from the working principle of the 500-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) which is designed to collect passive observations of radio signals from space, the new Fuyan will be actively shooting radio signals to celestial bodies in order to obtain new observations. ""This deep-space radar system would certainly cover full range in the Earth-Moon system, as the Moon is only some 400,000 kilometers away. And that would mean the system would be able to monitor country's spaceship and spacecraft's journey to Moon, which would be a great help for China's lunar exploration,"" Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Sunday. The system's high-definition active observation capability which stretches to a 150 million kilometers would be extremely valuable for us to learn about details of near-Earth asteroids and the more we know about it in terms of size, shape and flight information, the better can we defend or intervene its impact, Wang noted. As China's space technology has made achieved numerous noteworthy advances including successful deep-space exploration to Moon and Mars and also that in the sector of manned space programs, China is playing an increasingly important role in global efforts to defend against near-Earth asteroids, observers noted.                           "

Together, Wentian and Tianhe can support six taikonauts living in space during the rotations of two spacecraft crews. It also has an airlock through which taikonauts can exit, and a small robotic arm which can be used alone or combined with the large mechanical arm of the space station.According to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), after the space station combination receives the Wentian module, the Shenzhou-14 crew will enter Wentian to activate the life-support system, and complete the installation of scientific cabinets to enable them to carry out experiments in orbit.Also, the Wentian module will host a new Tiangong Classroom lecture series and the taikonauts will, for the first time, use the airlock in the Wentian module to exit the station for extravehicular activities or spacewalk missions, the CASC disclosed to the Global Times. The other lab module Mengtian is scheduled to be launched in October, said Hao Chun, director of the China Manned Space Agency. Research fellows at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) said on Monday that the Xuntian telescope, or ""Survey the Heavens,"" a space telescope research facility, is expected to be launched into orbit and fly with the space station in 2024 to carry out wide-area survey observations, the country's state media China Central Television reported. At present, new progress has been made in the development of the initial prototype of the optical facility. The telescope is expected to be launched after the completion of the space station and will become the flagship astronomy facility to explore the starry sea, the report said. The Xuntian telescope will be set up with an optical system with a diameter of two meters and equipped with a series of state-of-the-art probes. The size of the telescope is equivalent to a large bus, with the height about a three-story-tall building and weighing more than a dozen tons.It will keep some distance but fly with the Tianhe space station in the same orbit. When it needs to resupply, Xuntian will dock with the space station. The instrument and system components onboard can be replaced or upgraded through the help of the taikonauts. Some components can also be transported to the lab modules for maintenance, Zhan Hu, a research fellow with the National Astronomical Observatories under CAS, told media. According to the plan, the Xuntian telescope has a lifespan of 10 years, and can be prolonged under proper maintenance.                          "

Some 160 kilometers from north to south and nearly 600 kilometers from east to west of the stratums are naturally exposed.The geological landscape of the ""red mountain"" in Hoh Xil is expected to be developed into a large geopark, the expedition team mentioned. Located on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, Hoh Xil is the largest uninhabited area in China.The mountain contains rich geological formations closely related to the uplift process of the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau which provide important support for in-depth research on the evolution of the plateau.Shen said the ""red mountain"" in Hoh Xil was mainly formed during the late Cretaceous or early Paleogene period, between 70 and 30 million years ago.The ""red mountains"" were previously brick-red rocks in the Tanggula Mountain. After continuous weathering and denudation, those rocks were transported by rivers, deposited in the Hoh Xil basin and later exposed to the ground after geological tectonic movements, Shen said.The team from the China University of Geosciences in Wuhan is now on a scientific expedition at the source of the Yangtze River in Hoh Xil.

After a flight of about eight minutes, the Wentian module separated from the rocket and entered preset orbit, marking the success of the launch mission, the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement to the Global Times on Sunday.After about 13 hours of flight, the Wentian carried out a successful rendezvous and docking with the front port of the station's Tianhe core cabin, forming a linear combination structure, the CMSA announced.It was the first time that the taikonauts welcomed a visiting spacecraft. Before China, only the former Soviet Union and the US were capable of assembling ultra-large spacecraft in orbit.People on Earth shall witness the construction of the China Space Station with an unprecedented speed in mankind's history in the coming months. If all goes well, the Shenzhou-14 crew will be tasked with the most challenging mission in China's manned spaceflight history.According to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), upon receiving the Wentian module at the space station, the Shenzhou-14 crew will enter the Wentian to activate the life-support system and complete the installation of scientific equipment to carry out experiments in orbit.Before the Mengtian, the other space lab that will be launched in October, the Wentian will deck the right side of Tianhe core cabin, forming an L-shaped structure, China Space News, the official joint news outlet of the China Aerospace Science and the Technology Corp and China Academy of Space Technology, reported. For this to happen, the Shenzhou-14 taikonauts will perform three complex steering maneuvers to adjust the Wentian to a vertical position with the help of the robotic arm.Also, the Wentian will host a new Tiangong Classroom lecture series and the taikonauts will, for the first time, use the airlock in the Wentian module to exit the station for extravehicular activities, the CASC disclosed to the Global Times.Wentian's visit to the China Space Station carries with it multiple missions. It starts with the complete rendezvous and docking and later a transposition maneuver. Also, serving as a backup for the control and management center, it is capable of covering all task requirements needed for the space station assembly. Additionally, it will better ensure the safety of taikonauts by supporting their extravehicular activities and provide a platform for scientific experiments to be carried out in space.In normal conditions, the docking process would not need assistance from the taikonauts and they can carry out their own work as usual. Only when an emergency happens at a close distance of the space station will the ground command team hand over the remote control to crews onboard the station for manual operations, Yu Tianyi, Mission Commander for the Wentian, told the Global Times.Also, for the first time the solar panels on the Wentian have been deployed in two stages with the unfolding of the panels during its individual flight and the rest after the lab module docked to the station assembly.The reason for this design is that the extraordinarily long ""wings"" have a full span of over 55 meters, about half of a football field, setting a new record for solar panels used for China's spacecraft. Each panel has an unfolded area of about 110 square meters.Yu further explained that if the wings are fully unfolded right after the launch into orbit they can compromise the attitude control.

According to its developer, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), the 2.65-meter-diameter and 30-meter-long new rocket is the largest of its kind in China.The successful maiden flight of the ZK-1, which is intended to primarily support launching missions for small to medium-sized satellite spaceflights, has not only provided more capacity options for launches using a solid rocket, but also brought the country's development of this type of rocket to a world-class level.The CAS, in a statement it provided to the Global Times on Wednesday, said that what makes it a world-class solid rocket lies in multiple areas including its launch capacity, reliability and its cost efficiency for a launch mission.The rocket is a four-stage launch vehicle and weighs 135 tons at launch with a thrust of 200 tons. A fairing of 2.65 meters in diameter was atop the rocket during the Wednesday launch. The ZK-1 is capable of sending payloads of 1,500 kilograms into 500-kilometer Sun-synchronous orbits (SSO), the CAS disclosed. The six satellites sent into orbit during the ZK-1's maiden flight included a new space technology experiment satellite, an orbital atmosphere density surveying experiment satellite and a low-orbit quantum key distribution experiment satellite, according to a press release issued by the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on Wednesday. The ZK-1 is the latest member of China's solid propellant family that includes the Long March-11, which can be launched from land or sea, and the Kuaizhou-1.China has also developed the Smart Dragon-3, a solid rocket that is tasked to meet market needs in the domain of commercial space launches. It has a body diameter of up to 2.64 meters with a mass at launch of 140 tons, and it is capable of sending a payload of 1.5 tons into SSO.The Smart Dragon-3 rocket is expected to conduct three launches including its maiden one within 2022. The Academy of Aerospace Solid Propulsion Technology, which belongs to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC), developed and carried out a successful running test of a new huge solid rocket motor with a diameter of 3.5 meters and a remarkable thrust of 500 tons in 2021. The CASC has stated that it is the most powerful solid rocket motor with the largest thrust in the world so far.The rocket motor is expected to be used with heavy-lift rockets to meet various demands for launch vehicles during space missions like crewed landings on the moon and deep space exploration, the CASC said.For the unique advantage of a shorter preparation period before launches and therefore a faster response capability and lower cost for launches, increasingly more attention is being paid to solid rocket development around the world.The US and Europe are among the most competitive players in the race for solid rocket development. The US has its Minotaur rocket family that uses 2.34-meter motors from decommissioned Peacekeeper ICBMs, and Europe has recently successfully launched for the first time the Vega Consolidation or the Vega C solid rocket, which uses a 3.4-meter-diameter P120 motor that is capable of providing a thrust of more than 470 tons.                          "

This report is just the tip of iceberg in the US' sustained attempts to suppress and discredit China's space program. The US has also published military reports that incorrectly describe China's military capabilities in space, with the new NASA chief personally slandering China's space achievements, to promote the mindset of a new Cold War in space and the ""China threat"" theory. But facts show that the US is the biggest threat in space with its space hegemony based on its technological advantages. Meanwhile, China sees space as a new field to expand international cooperation while sharing its achievements with other countries by providing them with opportunities to make use of space resources.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-07-25/a1bef2fc-168f-4a18-8671-6dd428eb9dc9.jpeg," ""This NASA chief has a subpar standard with a small mind,"" Deng Yulin, an academic at the International Academy of Astronautics, said in an interview with the Global Times, commenting on the allegations in May by NASA's Administrator, Bill Nelson, that China is ""good at stealing"" American designs in the ""space race.""Nelson seems good at hyping the China-US competition in space, with US media often comparing it to the space competition during the Cold War between the US and the USSR. He also likes to link China's space program to military purposes, as he told German newspaper The Bild in July, saying that ""China's space program is a military one,"" ""Beijing was learning how to destroy satellites launched by other countries"" and ""China might take over the moon.""NASA is one of the US' most renowned scientific research institutes but Nelson has repeatedly made remarks that go against the spirit of science. This is just an example of the attempts by US domestic forces to contain China. Facing fast-advancing Chinese space development, some US politicians and military leaders who seek to maintain US hegemony ignore China's efforts in the peaceful use of space and are attempting to make it a new battlefield for China-US competition.Since Donald Trump's administration established the Space Force in 2019, the US military has repeatedly listed China's space program as its ""imaginary enemy."" The Pentagon's 2021 edition of Military and Security Developments involving the People's Republic of China, listed China's space capabilities as part of its military capabilities, calling infrastructure such as the Chinese space station, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and the Gaofen series remote-sensing satellites, which benefit the people, as military facilities. In the US' eyes, China's routine rocket launches reflect its military capabilities in space. A US Defense Intelligence Agency report in April claimed that, as of January 2022, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) now owns or operates ""about half of the world's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, most of which could support the monitoring, tracking, and targeting of US and allied forces worldwide.""But ironically, just as the US military promoted China's space infrastructure as being used for military purposes, three Chinese taikonauts had a ""Tiangong Q&A Session"" with a number of US students. Cosmic exploration and scientific research are never-ending and require concerted human efforts, said the Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang. ""We hope that the younger generation of both China and the US can be as courageous as the taikonauts, chasing their dreams and making contributions to humanity,"" Qin remarked.It was clearly stated in the ""China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective"" white paper released in January 2022 by the State Council Information Office that China has always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes and opposes any attempt to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield or start an arms race in outer space. China develops and uses space resources in a prudent manner, takes effective measures to protect the space environment, ensures that space remains peaceful and clean and guarantees that its space activities benefit humanity.The goal of China's space program has always been the peaceful use of space and promoting the development of a community of a shared future for mankind, which is a whole different concept from the space competition between the US and the USSR, Deng, the academic at the International Academy of Astronautics, said. US characters like Nelson hype the China-US space competition because they want increased funding and have been put under pressure by the rapid speed of China's space development, he said.In late 2021, the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space revealed that the US company's Starlink satellites had two close encounters with the China Space Station, leading the latter to implement preventive collision avoidance control for safety reasons. The two encounters were revealed in a note, dated December 3, by the Permanent Mission of China to the United Nations. The event had threatened the lives and safety of the taikonauts aboard the space station and exposed US spacecrafts' wanton activities in space that frequently threaten the normal operations of spacecrafts from other countries.But the US sees the evasive maneuvers of the Chinese spacecraft to avoid its satellite as a threat. US news outlets, including Space News, previously revealed several events in which Chinese and US satellites ""encountered"" each other in space. In a case earlier this year, US space surveillance satellite USA 270 maneuvered to get a closer look at two Chinese satellites soon after they reached geostationary orbit. As the US satellite closed in, the Chinese satellites took off in opposite directions, with one moving into position to get a sunlit view of the US surveillance satellite. Some US space experts with military background claimed the evasive maneuvers of the Chinese satellites proved China has gained ""anti-space"" capabilities. But it is obvious that it is the spying activities of the US in space that pose enormous security threats, and the propaganda from the US media against defensive measures of the Chinese satellites is just a vile trick.Huang Zhicheng, a Chinese expert in aerospace science and technology, told the Global Times that the US has long been militarizing space and is eagerly developing space weapons. For a long time, the US has been developing technologies to disrupt and capture other satellites.With the concept of establishing a community of a shared future for mankind, China is aiming to build a space environment that all mankind can use peacefully, Huang said. It is the US that needs arms control in space and to shoulder more responsibilities in space traffic management to give humanity a peaceful, prosperous, and open space environment, Huang said.US media outlets often judge China when reporting on China's space program, seeing China's space development from the view of the US mindset of hegemony. The National Interest report in July claimed that China's advancements in Tiangong Space Station, International Lunar Research Station, and small satellites were ""part of its strategy to rewrite the rules of conduct in outer space,"" and China could ""flout"" international norms. including the only binding pact, the Outer Space Treaty.But unlike the US, which makes no secret of its pursuit of space hegemony, China's space program has always been a reflection of the Chinese people's efforts to advance and contribute to the whole world, from the successful launch of China's first artificial satellite in 1970 to the imminent completion of China's space station in 2022. From the determination to rely on its own efforts reflected in the Spirit of Two Bombs, One Satellite, to the sincere devotion highlighted in the Spirit of Manned Spaceflight, the cooperation and mutual benefits stressed in the Spirit of Lunar Exploration, and the openness and integration outlined in the BeiDou Spirit in the New Era, the spirit of the Chinese people in space exploration advances through time and demonstrates to the whole world a Chinese path, a Chinese spirit, and Chinese strength.Since 2016, China has signed 46 space cooperation agreements or memoranda of understanding with 19 countries and regions and four international organizations. It has actively promoted the global governance of outer space and carried out international cooperation in space science, technology, and applications through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms, according to the white paper of China's space program. China has maintained a comprehensive cooperation with members of the European Union, countries and regions participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, members of ASEAN, the African Union members, the League of Arab States members, and countries in South America, in many space sectors including manned spaceflight, BeiDou Navigation, and deep space exploration. China always combines independence and self-reliance with opening up to the outside world, the white paper said. China actively engages in high-level international exchanges and cooperation and expands global public service for space technology and products. It takes an active part in solving major challenges facing humanity, helps to realize the goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and facilitates a global consensus and common effort on outer space exploration and utilization.Rumor:NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in German newspaper the Bild in July that ""China's space program is a military one,"" and Beijing was learning how to destroy satellites launched by other countries and ""China might take over the moon.""Fact:China has always advocated the use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and opposes any attempts to turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield, or start an arms race in outer space.Rumor:A Pentagon report in 2021 listed China's space capabilities as military threats, calling infrastructure such as the Chinese space station, the BeiDou Navigation Satellite System, and the Gaofen series remote-sensing satellites military facilities.Fact:Three Chinese taikonauts in April 2022 had a ""Tiangong Q&A Session"" with a number of US students, promoting the ideal that cosmic exploration and scientific research are never-ending and require concerted human efforts.Rumor:In a case earlier this year, Chinese satellites were forced to take evasive maneuvers from a US satellite close-in reconnaissance attempt, with some space experts with a US military background claiming this proved China has gained ""anti-space"" capabilities.Fact:US space surveillance satellite USA 270 maneuvered to conduct up-close reconnaissance on two Chinese satellites soon after they entered geostationary orbit, forcing the Chinese satellites to employ evasive measures.

The sea was divided into the upper Yangtze sea and lower Yangtze sea, connected by a narrow waterway, according to a press release by the institute on Thursday.The Tarim Basin, some 4,000 kilometers away in current Xinjiang, was connected to the South China blocks then, judging from similarities in ancient fish that lived in the two places.The ancient coastline was identified through a unique red stratum from the Silurian Period, which is characterized by fine rocks of purple-red, yellow and gray-green. The stratum is thicker at the border of the ancient land and ocean and thinner deep inside the ocean.The indicator species was the Galeaspids, an extinct kind of jawless marine and freshwater fish, which is striking similar in the unique red stratum. Their richness in Silurian Period stratum and extensive distributions across different regions make it an ideal species to compare and reconstruct ancient stratums.The fossils are also solid evidence to support the theory of continental drift. Fish fossils found in the Bachu area in Xinjiang are highly similar to those found in Changxing, East China's Zhejiang, and in Chaohu, East China's Anhui. The species of fish did not have a long-distance migration suggesting the two areas, 4,000 kilometers apart today, belong to the same sea floor more than 400 million years ago. The plate of the Tarim Basin was close to the equator at that time.The research results were published on volume 46 of the Journal of Stratigraphy.                         "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-11-24/1887b0b5-ac38-4389-a962-13d4c25df84c.jpeg," China's new-generation manned rocket, which is currently under development, will possess the capability to send taikonauts to the Moon by around 2030, Global Times has learned from China's state-owned space giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).A CASC spokesperson made the remarks to the media after the Long March 2D carrier rocket smoothly sent the remote sensing Yaogan-35 04 group of satellites on early Saturday morning, which saw the country's Long March rocket series breaking its own record with 103 consecutive successful space launch missions. According to the CASC spokesperson, the country's super heavy-lift launch vehicle, which is also under development, will receive further strengthening to become capable of sending payloads of 50 tons to the Earth-Moon transfer orbit on completion, in order to support future lunar activity. CASC is also working on a series of reusable space launch and transport systems, which will greatly boost the country's space shuttle capability, lowering costs and empowering future development in this domain, the spokesperson said, per a statement the CASC provided to the Global Times. Meanwhile, the US is busy preparing for the launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, which is set to take place on the morning of August 29 [US local time] from the US Kennedy Space Center for the Artemis I mission - the first test of NASA's deep space exploration systems. The Artemis I, according to the US space center, will be the first in a series of missions to demonstrate NASA's ability to extend human existence to the Moon and beyond.The US series' first crewed flight, the Artemis III, will see boots on the lunar surface no earlier than 2026, more than half a century since NASA successfully sent humans to the moon in December 1972 in the Apollo 17 mission.The US website space.com pointed out in an article on Friday that the 2026 mission is still ""highly uncertain,"" given that the mission is relatively far away, but NASA does have some early-stage planning for the later 2020s. The timeline for these missions depends a great deal on how much funding the agency receives from US Congress, along with the technical progress of the Artemis program, the report said.Even if NASA could pull off the ambitious plan, it would already be a two-year delay as the US space agency has abandoned its original goal of sending humans to the moon by 2024. Drawing a comparison between the lunar manned landing plans of China and the US, Chinese space experts pointed out that the US' practice of setting specific year deadlines is very rare in the industry, given the complex nature of deep space exploration, while China focuses more on technology readiness in a rather broad time frame, going forward steadily and surely. China's crewed moon landing is more in line with scientific principles, but NASA might grow more hostile against China in the space domain given the huge pressure it is facing to maintain its global leadership in moon exploration, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of the Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Sunday, when asked if there would be a new space race between space powers around 2030. , in a groundless accusation that China wants to ""occupy the moon,"" citing the lunar research base that China and Russia are co-building, which he is ""very concerned about.""It is very likely that in order to meet the goals of the Artemis mission, given its tight timeline, NASA will further open management access of the International Space Station (ISS) to commercial space players such as SpaceX after 2024, as Russia has warned of its intention to pull out from the ISS by that year, and shift focus and resources to its lunar plans, Wang noted. Space observers also pointed out that as NASA is trying hard to relive its Apollo glories, China is working on innovative plans to carry out its own crewed moon landing missions. Even without the new-generation manned rocket and super-heavy lift launch vehicle, leading Chinese rocket scientist Long Lehao revealed in August 2021, China could use two rocket launches to send two taikonauts to the moon by around 2030.Long, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and chief designer of the Long March rockets, said during a speech that China was planning to use new variants of the Long March-5 launch vehicle - the strongest member of the Long March rocket family - to carry out the manned space launch missions.Long referred to the new variant as Long March-5 DY, which stands for ""dengyue,"" meaning ""lunar landing"" in Chinese. Two rockets carrying a lunar lander and a next-generation manned spaceship will be launched for the mission, and the two parts of the spacecraft will rendezvous and dock in near-lunar orbit, before executing the landing process. The two taikonauts are expected to work on the moon's surface for some six hours, according to Long. However, there is no mention of a specific landing site. The new manned spaceship will then take off from the moon and carry out another docking with the orbiting module before heading back to Earth.

Weighing 510 kilograms, it operates at an altitude of 517 kilometers in a dusk-dawn Sun-synchronous orbit. It's equipped with an imaging spectrometer, making it the first in the world to have realized spectral imaging observations of the H-alpha band of the Sun, the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST), designer and manufacturer of the satellite, told the Global Times in a statement on Tuesday.The H-alpha band is one of the best spectral lines to study solar activity. By analyzing the data of this line, people can obtain changes of physical quantities such as atmospheric temperatures and velocity during a solar eruption, and study the dynamic process and physical mechanism of a solar eruption.The spectrometer on the Xihe has a resolution of 0.0024 nanometers, about 10 times higher than the resolution of ground-based optical filters, reaching the international advanced level.Each spectral scan image contains more than 300 photos, which can be regarded as a ""CT scan"" of the Sun's lower atmosphere. In each image, information of nearly 16 million points on the solar surface is reflected.In addition to the H-alpha band spectral imaging, it has also for the first time in the world obtained the fine structures of the SiΙ and FeΙ spectral lines in orbit. Based on these observations, the activity occurring in the solar atmosphere can be recorded in detail, and the physical processes of solar activity can be studied. So far, the Xihe has observed nearly 100 solar outbursts. Related research work is underway.In another first, the satellite has applied magnetic levitation technology in orbit to increase accuracy and stability during operation.The technology has raised the attitude control level of the satellite by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching the international advanced level. The technology will be promoted in next-generation space missions such as high-resolution remote sensing, solar stereo exploration and exoplanet discovery, among others.""Solar activity has a great impact on Earth, especially the radiation of cosmic rays and solar wind, which can cause serious interference to the Earth's magnetic field, including communications systems. Therefore, it is necessary to study the movement of the Sun,"" Song Zhongping, a TV commentator who closely follows China's space program, told the Global Times on Tuesday.China plans to carry out solar research programs including the Sun-Earth Lagrange L5 point exploration, observing the Sun from different directions and distances, to address important scientific questions such as the generation and evolution of the solar magnetic field and its relationship with solar activity, as well as the physical mechanism of solar eruptions and their impact on space weather.The Sun-Earth Lagrange L5 point project is considered as vital for the development of solar exploration in China. Using the special advantage of the Sun-Earth Lagrange L5 point, probes can stably observe the Sun and interplanetary space for a long time, and observe the active regions of the Sun that will face the Earth four to five days in advance. They can also monitor the whole process of a solar eruption spreading to Earth. International solar exploration has entered a new stage, with various technologies and methods of all-dimensional, multi-view and multi-band exploration making great progress.India plans to implement the AdityA-1 program in 2022, which will place a satellite in the halo orbit around the Lagrangian point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system for integrated solar observation.NASA's PUNCH mission, which consists of four suitcase-sized satellites, will be launched in 2025 to study the Sun's outer atmosphere, the corona, and how it generates the solar wind, according to Science Daily, a US-based media outlet.A China-Europe joint space mission, Solar Wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer, is scheduled to send satellites into space before the end of 2024 to study the interaction mechanism between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere.

The illness typically occurs in early childhood, with stem cell transplantation being the only definitive curative therapy. Previous studies have found 12 risk genes, but they can explain only a small proportion of the HLH cases. Now a new study, the findings of which were published in the Journal of Hematology & Oncology, may help doctors to screen the high-risk populations of the genetic disease and raise the early diagnosis and treatment rate. Using whole-genome sequencing technology, researchers from the Beijing Institute of Genomics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing Children's Hospital of the Capital Medical University, identified a novel gene called NBAS in Chinese patients with HLH. According to the study, which covered 237 cases, the estimated frequency of NBAS variants among the child patients was 2.11 percent, making it the second most frequently mutated gene. The first one called PRF1 has a mutation rate of 3.8 percent. The research is the latest example of China's intensified research efforts to rescue millions of patients with rare diseases in the country.                         "

However, they slammed the political considerations and Cold War mentality behind the NASA's Artemis program, which they said could lead to catastrophic outcomes.    The scrub was called at 11:17 am US Eastern time on Saturday, three hours before the beginning of the launch window, which has certainly disappointed some space enthusiasts. Liquid hydrogen is one of the propellants used in the rocket's large core stage. The leak prevented the launch team from being able to fill the liquid hydrogen tank. It was not the first time hydrogen leaks have bedeviled efforts to fuel the mega Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, as similar ones appeared during dress rehearsals and the first try at launch. However NASA officials described the leak on Saturday as much larger and they are now studying the problem and discussing the next steps, US media reported. The stack, including the SLS rocket and the Orion spacecraft, has to roll back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, unless they could get a waiver to remain on the launchpad until another attempt, the US officials said, that would not happen during the current launch period that ends on Tuesday. Instead, they said the earliest they could try for another launch would be late September.NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said that the Space Shuttle was sent back to the Vehicle Assembly Building 20 times before it launched and the cost of two scrubs is a lot less than a failure. ""We do not launch until we think it's right,"" Nelson said. ""These teams have labored over that and that is the conclusion they came to. I look at this as part of our space program, in which safety is the top of the list.""The issues so far appeared with the SLS rocket were fairly reasonable, given that the US has paused development of such mega lunar landing rocket since it managed for the last time to send human to the Earth's natural satellite half a century ago, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of the Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Sunday.Wang said that being able to immediately locate the problems with precision itself shows the maturity of the US space launch technology. ""Allowing no potential risks during launch is a common practice in the industry,"" he said.US NPR reported on Sunday, citing remarks of NASA's inspector general, that each of the first few flights of the Artemis program will cost more than $4 billion, excluding billions of dollars in development stage, and some critics has slammed that the program would be too expensive to be sustainable if NASA continues to depend on this rocket and capsule, both of which come with a hefty price tag. In fact, the SLS rocket, although inheriting a range of key technology from the Space Shuttle such as the main engines and solid rocket boosters, is no stranger to delays. The rocket is already years behind its original schedule as the US Congress had wanted it to fly in 2016, just five years after NASA retired its aging fleet of space shuttles.Despite the recent Artemis 1 delays, Nelson said on Saturday that NASA's plan to launch Artemis 2 in 2024 and Artemis 3 in 2025 remain intact. The US space agency aims to land diverse astronaut crews at previously unexplored regions of the moon - on the Artemis II and Artemis III missions, slated for 2024 and 2025 respectively - and eventually delivers crewed missions to Mars.However, Chinese space analysts questioned the nature of the Artemis program, which they said is political with strong Cold War mentality, pointing to a recent State of the Space Industrial Base report for 2022 written by US officials with US Space Force, Defense Innovation Unit, Air Force, and Air Force Research Laboratory that claimed that China could overtake the US and become the world's dominant space power ""economically, diplomatically, and militarily"" by 2045. The US officials argue in the report released on August 24 that the US must quickly act to maintain its advantage over Beijing, including using more commercial technology and setting long-term, bipartisan policy goals.""This vision must be as clear and ambitious in scale and timeline as the PRC and more inclusive of international collaboration across the spectrum of commercial, civil and national security space activities,"" the report says. ""For the first time, participants expressed concerns that China appears to be on track to surpass the US as the dominant space power by 2045 or potentially earlier unless proactive measures are taken now to sustain our nation's leadership.""It shows the US' lack of self-confidence, and by picturing China as an imaginary enemy in space and promoting space colonialism, Washington is trying to repeat the Space Race it engaged with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, Song Zhongping, a space observer and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday, adding that such a mentality, which contains nothing scientific but purely political aims, could lead to catastrophic outcomes to the current tight-scheduled Artemis program. Song also battered the so-called China-excluding international collaboration the US is targeting as ""hypocritical,"" saying that such narrow-mindedness and selfish acts would only hinder human beings' advancement as a whole in the space exploration.                          "

Taikonauts Chen Dong and Liu Yang kicked off their spacewalk on Thursday and completed all extravehicular tasks at 00:33 (Beijing Time) on Friday, lasting about six hours. It is the fifth spacewalk outside China's space station and the first out of the newly-launched Wentian lab module. Assisted by taikonaut Cai Xuzhe inside the lab module, the pair completed a series of tasks, including the installation of the extended pump set of the Wentian lab module, lifting the lab module's panoramic camera, and the verification of capability for independent transfer and emergency return to the spacecraft. EASIER EXIT Compared with their predecessors who exited the station's core module, the Shenzhou-14 taikonauts went out from a larger doorway into space. According to the China Manned Space Agency, the diameter of the exit hatch of the core module is 0.85 meters, while that of the Wentian module reaches 1 meter. It allowed the taikonauts wearing puffy spacesuits to go through easier. Pictures and videos later supplied by the space agency showed the pair opening the module hatch and using a robotic arm to maneuver equipment with Earth in the background. LONGER LIFELINE One of the most vital equipment pieces to keep taikonauts from floating away into space is a safety tether, the equivalent of a simple rope connecting their spacesuits to the spacecraft. When the Shenzhou-7 taikonaut Zhai Zhigang performed China's first spacewalk in 2008, a 1-meter fixed-length tether was his lifeline. For spacewalks on the space station, Chinese scientists have developed a new retractable steel wire rope, which ensures a safe connection of more than 10 meters between taikonauts and spacecraft. The lifeline can also withstand irradiation, particles, and a temperature difference of nearly 200 degrees Celsius in space. SMARTER SYSTEM Thanks to two lamps outside the Wentian lab module, the Shenzhou-14 taikonauts carried out extravehicular operations in a brighter environment than in previous missions. Apart from guiding spacewalkers in the darkness of the universe, the Wentian lighting system has also provided taikonauts with favorable lighting conditions inside. Unlike on Earth, taikonauts will experience about 14 sunrises and sunsets each day in orbit, which can cause changes in their biological clocks, probably resulting in sleep disorders, fatigue, and work efficiency reduction. The lighting system enables them to control the internal lights through a cell phone app, so they can switch lights between sleep, work, exercise, and other modes to avoid discomfort during the six-month spaceflight. China launched the Shenzhou-14 spaceship on June 5. The crew has completed tasks such as arranging cargo, testing equipment, and conducting scientific experiments on the country's under-construction space station.                         "

It is a landmark product that China has advanced to the world space power. When reached by the Global Times on Tuesday, the engine developers with the Sixth Academy of the state-owned aerospace giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC), declined to provide further details of the new engine model and no video footage is available to show the test process. However, space observers speculated that the new engine system is likely to be used as the third stage and upper stage for the country's highly anticipated Long March-9 super heavy-lift rocket, which would boost China's future space endeavors in the fields including manned Moon and Mars landing, among other deep space exploration programs. A space expert, who asked not to be named, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the exciting 25-ton engine being tested could be the YF-79 engines, which is even more powerful than the current YF-75D engine atop the Long March-5 - the strongest Chinese launch vehicle to date.Four such YF-79 engines working in a group to constitute the third stage for the Long March-9 heavy duty vehicle, providing a thrust of some 100 tons, the expert noted. So far, China has announced a successful running test for its domestically developed 500-ton level liquid-oxygen kerosene rocket engine, which is speculated to be codenamed the YF-130 rocket engine with a 50 percent rated working condition in March 2021; and the completion of the development of a prototype for the 220-ton YF-90 oxygen-hydrogen rocket engine in July 2021, according to media reports.Space observers said that it seems that the YF-130 rocket engine for the Long March-9 vehicle's first stage, the YF-90 engine for the second stage, and now the YF-79 rocket engine for the third and upper stage have all achieved major development breakthroughs. China is moving closer to the final completion of the heavy-duty launch vehicle which will help the country to develop to be a world space power. According to what Jiang Jie, the chief designer with the China Academy of Launch Vehicle who is also a China Academy of Sciences academician, has said in March, the development of the super heavy-lift which is of epoch-making significance, would take eight to 10 years. Space observers noted that according to all the information gathered, the maiden flight for the new generation super heavy-lift vehicle could be expected within the next five year plan of 2026 to 30.

The six days streamlined process includes three days at the general assembly stage and two days at the testing stage, according to the CALT. The roll-out of the Long March-7A is believed to fill in a void in the country's launch capacity to the geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) for payload weighing from 5.5 to 7 tons, and it is currently compatible with two sizes of nose cones with 4.2-meter-diameter or with 3.7-meter-diamter. The CALT also revealed that a new configuration of the Long March-7A with a 5.2-meter-diameter nose cone will also be developed according to the overall development trend of high-orbit satellites, meeting the demands of the launch of these satellites with larger-sized antennas and further improving the rocket's mission adaptability.The satellite put in orbit during Tuesday mission will be used to provide high quality communication, radio and television services for users, according to the CALT. The maiden flight of Long March 7A ended in failure on March 16, 2020 due to a loss of pressure, which led to engine malfunction. Despite the ongoing pandemic and the complications brought by social distancing rules at the time, developers never stopped reexamining and studying the cause of the failure. In merely nine months, a correction of the original piece rolled out and passed the final round of tests on December 30, 2020.The rocket type made a successful comeback on March 12, 2021, sending a technology verification satellite into preset orbit, also from the Wenchang spaceport.                          "

At the same time, the Tianwen-1 mission has also laid a solid foundation for subsequent interplanetary exploration by China.According to the China National Space Administration (CNSA), as of Thursday, the Tianwen-1 Mars probe had been in orbit for more than 780 days, traveling a total of 1,921 meters, completing its scientific exploration tasks and acquiring 1,480 gigabytes of raw scientific exploration data, China Central Television (CCTV) reported on Sunday.Through the comprehensive study of typical landforms such as concave cones, wall impact craters and trenches distributed in the landing area, the scientific research team has revealed the important connection between the formation of landforms and water activity in Zhurong's landing area.Camera images and spectroscopic data show that there are water-bearing minerals in the slabby crustal rocks near the landing area, which provides evidence that there was a large amount of liquid water activity in Zhurong's landing area as long as 1 billion years ago.""As liquid water activity has been found, we believe that there may have been some suitable climate conditions for the origin of life or the existence of such conditions in the past billion years on Mars,"" Liu Yang, a researcher at the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), told CCTV. ""These climate conditions are likely to be in a more moderate space underground.""These new results reveal the influence of Martian sand and water activity on geological evolution and environmental changes, provide strong support for the conjecture that oceans once existed on the Martian utopian plain, and enrich human scientific knowledge of the geological evolution and environmental changes on Mars, the CNSA said.The scientific research team also used the Tianwen-1 probe data to obtain a number of outstanding scientific results on the relationship between the density of rocks on the Martian surface and the degree of surface erosion, the distribution of ions and neutral particles in the near-Mars space environment, as well as the Martian gravity field.""The fact that the Tianwen-1 gives Chinese scientists first-hand data means that we can most fundamentally parse our scientific story from the raw data,"" said Pan Yongxin, Tianwen-1 mission science applications chief scientist. Pan noted that the independence on obtaining data indicates that China's initiative in scientific discovery will be enhanced.Through the Tianwen-1 mission, China has achieved hundreds of millions of kilometers of long-distance data transmission, and also mastered how to effectively extract scientific data, laying a solid foundation for subsequent interplanetary exploration, CCTV reported.The Tianwen-1 orbiter continues to carry out scientific exploration in the remote sensing mission orbit, and continues to accumulate first-hand scientific data to contribute to the in-depth knowledge of Mars for human beings, the CNSA said. The Zhurong rover is currently in hibernation and is expected to be woken up at the end of the year when Mars environmental conditions improve. After its normal working condition is confirmed, Zhurong will continue to travel southward to obtain more roving probe data.The results of this research have been published in prestigious academic journals such as Nature Astronomy, Nature Geoscience, Science Advances and Science China.The timely publication of these scientific results in international journals shows that China has always shown an open attitude toward international cooperation, Song Zhongping, a space observer and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""The Chinese scientists have used their own means and technology to implement Mars exploration, and have achieved fruitful results,"" Song said.

The successful maiden flight test marks a major breakthrough in engine reusability development, the Global Times learned from the developers.The reusable engine model was developed by Xi'an Aerospace Propulsion Institute, a subsidiary of the 6th Academy of the state-owned aerospace giant China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).In the verification flight test, the engine first served as the main engine in the maiden flight and after being inspected and maintained, successfully supported another repeated flight test, realizing the reuse of liquid rocket propulsion for the first time in the country's aerospace history, according to the Xi'an-based developers.Zhang Xiaojun, head of the Xi'an-based institute, said it showed that engine reusability technology in the country has reached a practical use stage, and he vowed that they will continue to explore technology solutions in order to provide robust support for the country's space program.The Xi'an institute did not reveal the thrust of the engine or what launch vehicle was deployed in the flight test as of press time. The CASC Sixth Academy told the Global Times that further details concerning the test would be released on Wednesday.The US Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) achieved partial reusability in the 1980s, but the SSME did not reach its designed capability of being reusable for 55 flights in practice before its retirement with the Space Shuffle in 2011. According to Mark Adler, a former NASA JPL system engineer, each Space Shuttle Main Engine was designed for 55 flights but they actually flew an average of about 10 flights each.Technology developed by SpaceX known as the reusable vertical takeoff, vertical landing rocket (VTVL) which conducted a successful landing in 2015 and at a sea platform in 2016 marked the latest development of reusable launch vehicle technology in the 21st century.China's new generation medium-sized launch vehicle Long March-8 made a successful maiden flight in December 2020. It is believed to have the potential to be reusable in the future. According to plans revealed by the CASC, the first stage of Long March-8 is expected to become reusable 10 times by 2025, and by 2035, the entire rocket is expected to be reusable.Long March-8's enhanced variant in the future could be the first Chinese rocket to become a VTVL launcher, space observers said.

Together, Chen and Liu completed the installation of the extended pump set of the Wentian and the lifting of the panoramic camera, as well as other tasks with the help of the small robotic arm, and carried out emergency return capability verification.Unlike previous times when the Shenzhou-12 and -13 crews exited the space station through the Tianhe core cabin, the Shenzhou-14 crew for the first time ventured out through the airlock cabin in the Wentian lab module, which just arrived at the space station on July 25.The node cabin for the taikonauts' exit in the Tianhe has a gate width of 85 centimeters, while the airlock cabin in the Wentian is one meter wide, allowing taikonauts with space suits on and equipment in hand to walk more ""freely"" into space, developer and manufacturer of the cabin the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) said in a statement it sent to the Global Times.Therefore, the airlock cabin of the Wentian will become the main exit-entry point for extravehicular activities, while the previous one in the Tianhe will serve as backup. The two exit-entry cabins will greatly boost the reliability and better ensure the safety of taikonauts in case of an emergency during extravehicular work, according to Li Jinlin, a chief designer of extravehicular suits at the Astronaut System at the China Manned Space Agency.Exiting from the Wentian lab module instead of the Tianhe means that the taikonauts must take different routes and that requires a number of technical adjustments, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Thursday. The successful mission has verified the feasibility of using the Wentian as the main exit-entry gate, experts noted.Thursday's mission also verified the functions of the five-meter-long small robotic arm installed outside the airlock cabin. With seven degrees of freedom, the set has a higher precision and flexibility to ""grasp"" small and medium-sized pieces of equipment, and is capable of more delicate operations than the bigger robotic arm with the Tianhe module.During the construction stage of the space station, taikonauts have to complete equipment installation, maintenance and other tasks outside the cabin. With a greater range of movement needed for a more challenging extravehicular activity, safety requirements have also become more stringent.Therefore, research teams have developed a longer and retractable safety rope, allowing more than 10 meters of connection between the taikonauts and the module. This will not only pose little interference to spacesuits or the movement of the taikonauts, but will also withstand the test of the space environment with a 200 C temperature gap, space irradiation and other harsh conditions, the CAST noted.Over more than three years, ground research teams have independently developed 238 outboard maintenance tools in 36 categories for the core module and the Wentian lab module, with a total weight of 509 kilograms, it added.Another highlight of Thursday's mission is the support of domestically developed high-end aerospace chips. Considered as the cells and even the heart of a spacecraft, China has made major progresses in increasing their quality and quantity, in the face of a crackdown by the US.On Wednesday, US chip designer Nvidia Corp said that the US government told the company to stop exporting two top computing chips for artificial intelligence work to China, reported Reuters.China has been making steady progress in planning extravehicular activities. The first batch of taikonauts entering the Tianhe, the Shenzhou-12 crew, carried out one spacewalk mission, while for their successor, the Shenzhou-13 crew, two missions were successfully completed. The Shenzhou-14 squad is expected to conduct two to three spacewalk missions.Experts said that compared with previous times, which were more focused on technology verification, Shenzhou-14's extravehicular activities are more task-oriented.With extravehicular activity becoming more regular, related technologies have also become more mature. The Shenzhou-12 and -13 missions were mainly for technical verification but now with the Shenzhou-14, these technologies will enter the application stage, as our Wentian module has arrived, and a lot of basic work needs to be done, Song Zhongping, a TV commentator who closely follows China's space program, told the Global Times on Thursday.""Meanwhile, a large amount of preparation work is also needed for the upcoming Mengtian launch and docking, so now we are following the actual needs of building the space station to arrange extravehicular activities, and that's very different from the previous mission,"" Song said.Since they arrived at China's space station on June 5, the three crew members of Shenzhou-14 have spent 88 days in orbit. They have completed multiple tasks including the transfer of materials from the cargo spacecraft, in-orbit testing of the Wentian lab module, unlocking the science experiment cabinets, functional tests of the small robotic arm, and the management of the space station assembly, according to the CMSA.

Thus, it can induce a localized immune response targeting the mucosal surfaces to which pathogens attach instead of inducing a systematic immune response, which is facilitated by intramuscular vaccines.The research findings strengthen recent evidence that targeted mucosal immunization may be an effective strategy for controlling the expecting spike in BA.5-induced infections in the COVID-19 pandemic based on two inactivated vaccines.New subvariants of Omicron BA.5 including and  have been discovered in multiple places across China including South China's Guangdong Province, North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and East China's Shandong Province over the past few days. Both of the new subvariants are highly infectious with fast spreading speed. Experts have warned that if decisive prevention measures were not adopted in time, there is high possibility that they could become the dominant variants in China.Global Times                         "

Macau University of Science and Technology also runs the State Key Laboratory of Lunar and Planetary Sciences, the only state key laboratory in the field of astronomy and planetary sciences in China.Fellow member Gary Wong Chi-him, who is also on the board of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Monday that colleges and universities in Hong Kong and Macao have set up specialist courses over the recent years. This selection of payload specialists by the central government in Hong Kong and Macao SARs is a great gift to young people in the two regions.""Many young people around me are very excited about this project. Some of them have already started working toward the selection criteria, hoping to stand out and realize their space dreams,"" Wong said. The Civil Aviation Authority, Education and Youth Development Bureau and Health Bureau under the Macao SAR Government jointly held a press conference on Monday, announcing that the central government decided to select one payload specialist from Macao to undertake scientific research work such as conducting in-orbit experiments in addition to operating experimental equipment.Chan Weng Hong, President of the Civil Aviation Authority of Macao SAR, said that the selection of candidates for payload specialist in Macao fully reflects the country's care and support for Macao. The selection will be conducted across three stages -- primary election, review and final race. The Macao SAR government is completing registration work from Monday to October 17.A student from Macao told the Global Times that she was surprised and pleased to hear this news as she had taken an interest in the country's space program since childhood. ""I have long been thinking that space is a very distant thing and has never thought one day myself could have the opportunity to achieve space dream,"" she said.Some college students in Macao also said they hoped that in the near future there could be more scientists, space pilots and flight engineers from Macao to get involved in national space development. Legislators from Hong Kong and Macao believe that the selection program would encourage more young people in the two regions to participate more actively in the national construction and contribute to the overall development of the country.Kou Kam Fai, a member of the seventh Legislative Assembly of the Macao SAR, told the Global Times that China has been developing manned space engineering for 30 years and each great achievement so far has deepened people's sense of pride in Macao. ""Chinese taikonauts have visited Macao many times and conducted warm exchanges with local students, which greatly stimulated their strong passion for exploring the space sector.""It is a great opportunity for students in Macao to get a closer look at the country's manned space achievements, to strengthen their national consciousness and make their contributions to the country's overall development, Kou said. Lam added that the central government has always been concerned about the development of Hong Kong's youth, and has been trying to open up more channels to enable young people to seize the development opportunities of the country and help them integrate into the overall development of the country.

The energy of such events is usually measured in giga-electronvolts (GeV), with a few being recorded with energies of abpit 1 tera-electronvolt (TeV), New Atlas, a news website focusing on world's science and technology advancement, reported on Friday. However, this new event has reached a record-breaking 18 TeV, marking the first detection of a GRB with energies above 10 TeV, which is more than 10 times brighter than the brightest GRB ever observed by humans.GRBs are immensely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies. They are the most energetic and luminous electromagnetic events since the Big Bang. Bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several hours. The energy released by GRBs can exceed the total amount of energy radiated by the sun during its lifetime. This high-intensity burst found by Chinese astronomers occurred at a distance of more than two thousand trillion light years from Earth, a distance so close that it is estimated to occur only once in decades or even a century, the China National Radio report said.  The LHAASO detection has triggered a tremendous international response, with a large number of related studies rapidly underway and discussions about new physical possibilities emerging. At the same time, these measurements will place strong constraints on fundamental physical parameters and models such as the background light field present in the universe, and are expected to yield important cognitive level improvements.Cao Zhen, chief scientist of LHAASO, led his team to initiate data analysis for the GBR in no time, and has released the preliminary results to the international community via the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network within less than two days of the observation. Further data analysis and scientific studies are being carried out by members of the LHAASO collaborative group.LHAASO is located in the mountains of the eastern Qinghai-Xizang Plateau at an altitude of 4,410 meters, and is a major part of the national scientific and technological infrastructure to observe and study cosmic rays. and began its first scientific observation in April 2019.

Experts noted that advances in this technology are significant for the transmission of information that requires confidentiality.In quantum cryptography, the secret key is sent in the form of photons, which cannot be cracked or copied. But there are risks with this type of transmission. If QKD is not performed exactly the right way, it becomes vulnerable to light-injection attacks, in which extra bright light is added to the QKD fiber and invisibly penetrates inside the secure stations to carry away bits of the secret key, according to Russia's National University of Science and Technology (MISIS), an institute that participated in the research.To address this concern, physicists and security professionals have long been searching for effective countermeasures to prevent these hacks.The scientists proposed one solution involving the addition of a sacrificial cheap device at the exit end of quantum key distribution fiber sources to resist light-injection attacks or break the quantum key transmission before hacking is successful.The researchers examined off-the-shelf optical isolators and circulators by burning them with a high-power fiber laser, and found that they could serve this function.""The result of the work was the creation of reliable protection against this class of attacks. We hope that the countermeasure we tested will be immediately applied in all industrial systems of quantum cryptography,"" said Vadim Makarov, head of the Laboratory of Analysis of Practical Vulnerabilities of Quantum Cryptography Systems and Development of Certification Methods of the MISIS University Quantum Communications Competence Center of NTI.Quantum communication technology is much more secure compared with the common communication modes, Xiang Ligang, a veteran analyst of the telecom industry, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Under the mode of quantum direct communication, once there is an attack, it will automatically stop, Xiang said, noting that advances in this technology are significant for the transmission of information that requires confidentiality.""This technology mainly addresses security problems, so it is not particularly noticeable for average consumers. However, telecom operators will demand it,"" Xiang said, further explaining that in the process of information transmission involving state secrets or other sensitive information, confidentiality measures should be taken to prevent eavesdropping or interception of information.According to Xiang, although a series of breakthroughs have been made in the current quantum communication technology, the technology of quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) has not yet been applied in practice. However, it will hopefully be realized in the future.A white paper on research into 6G released in 2021 pointed out that QSDC has the ability to detect eavesdropping, which has great potential in the next generation of secure communications.The scientists from the Quantum Communications Competence Center of NTI in partnership with the Russian Quantum Center, as well as researchers from the ITMO University, the National University of Defense Technologies (NUDT) in China and the Quantum Technology Foundation of Thailand (QTFT) participated in the latest research.The experiment was described in the PRX Quantum international journal and noted by the American Physical Society.The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists, including French physicist Alain Aspect, American physicist John Clauser and Austrian physicist Anton Zeilinger for work exploring quantum weirdness. Their independent works explored the foundations of quantum mechanics and the paradoxical rules that govern behavior in the subatomic world.Global Times                         "

The team used TanSat carbon dioxide data captured in May 2018 near Tangshan, North China's Hebei Province, and in March 2018 near Tokyo, Japan. They compared the TanSat data to nitrogen dioxide measurements captured by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite on the same dates over the same cities, according to CAS. Their two case studies showed TanSat carbon dioxide measurements have the capability of capturing the anthropogenic variations in the plume and have spatial patterns like that of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument's nitrogen dioxide observations. Concentrations of carbon dioxide continue to rise because of human activities such as fossil fuel combustion and land-use change. The emissions related to the combustion of fossil fuels are particularly localized, with urban areas being the dominant contributor responsible for more than 70 percent of global emissions, Yang Dongxu, a research fellow from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of CAS, told the Global Times on Tuesday.  The   International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week that it predicted global carbon dioxide emissions would stand at 33.8 billion tons in 2022, 300 million tons more than in 2021, the AFP reported. Yet it has been especially challenging for scientists to obtain the high precision measurements they needed to study anthropogenic emissions from cities, he said. This is the first attempt to use TanSat measurements to detect anthropogenic, or human-caused, carbon dioxide emission signatures, Yang said. TanSat, launched in 2016, is China's first global carbon dioxide monitoring satellite. Tan is Chinese pronunciation of carbon.The carbon monitoring satellite helps scientists better understand the current situation of carbon emissions and carbon sinks, which could provide data support as well as policy optimization for China's carbon goals, Yang said. China aims to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Looking ahead, the team has plans to expand this research. ""The TanSat is our first attempt on global carbon monitoring. The next generation of China's Global Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Satellite mission, TanSat-2, is now in the design phase,"" said Liu Yi, also from the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of CAS. According to Liu, TanSat-2's target measurements will focus on recording the gradient of carbon dioxide from city central to rural areas using an imaging process and a 500-meter footprint size to improve the emission estimation accuracy. TanSat-2 will be a constellation of satellites distributed into at least two orbits in the morning and afternoon to cover a city or a point source twice a day.                          "

This marks a breakthrough for energy system integration and management technology, offering high security and stability, experts explained.Moreover, the mission also included the underwater joint operation of the base station, the in-situ laboratory and the Deep-Sea Warrior.Chen Jun, an associate researcher at the IDSSE, said that with the large power capacity of the base station, the sea trial also verified the base station's submarine navigation capability and its autonomous movement function, which enables precise deployment of the base station on the seabed and operations at multiple sites.The base station can support the connection of platforms such as the in-situ laboratory and supply power to them, while the platforms are connected to each other for long-term collaborative detection and more flexible operating modes, he added.During the 11-day trial, the Deep-Sea Warrior manned submersible completed its 500th dive to a depth of 1,450 meters and returned to the Exploration-2 vessel after nine hours underwater.Since 2017, the average underwater time of the Deep-Sea Warrior for all 500 dives was 8 hours and 17 minutes, with the longest time being 12 hours and 53 minutes. The average depth of the submersible was 1,957 meters, and the maximum depth was 4,546 meters.More than 227 personnel from 61 institutions at home and abroad, including scientific research institutes, universities and enterprises, have participated in the operation during the past five years, carrying out deep-sea scientific investigation and research, underwater search, and emergency rescue.

There is also a space bicycle similar to the one in the Tianhe core module in the Wentian living area. Chen, the mission commander, presented the scientific glove cabin and practiced sampling operations for the thale cress plants onboard with the help of a pair of mixed reality goggles. According to Chen, the device could provide an airtight and clean operation space in the lab module and could be used to carry out macrometer-level experiments such as cell penetration with high precision. It can also provide low-temperature storage conditions ranging from - 80 C to 4 C, according to different experiments' requirements.Liu presented the life and ecology experiment cabin, and likened the device to a space hotel for different species. It is expected to improve humankind's understanding about life itself and explore the influence of microgravity on life, among other life science goals.The seeds of thale cress and rice plants were brought to the space hotel by taikonauts on July 28. After growing for 54 days in space, the rice seeds have entered a seed maturity stage from the pustulation period. On September 21, taikonauts sampled some of the rice plants and put them into a freezer for storage, and they will bring these samples back to Earth for further analysis. The harvested rice plants successfully grew regenerated rice. A biological technology experiment cabin and a variable gravity experiment cabinet inside the Wentian module were also presented by Chen and Liu at the session. Cai played the role of the cameraman mostly during the event. Just like previous Tiangong Classroom lecture series, Chen and Liu demonstrated a number of quite interesting physics phenomena in the weightless environment, such as the capillary phenomenon in space and the different behaviors of liquid and liquid-solid mixtures under the same impact, after which they explained the science behind them.In the routine question and answer interaction, the Shenzhou-14 taikonauts encouraged the young students to study hard and dream big, and wished they could build the country's permanent space home even better. The Beijing Space Information Transmission Center deployed the Tianlian-1 03 and Tianlian-2 01 relay communication satellites to support the Tiangong Classroom lecture on Wednesday, which lasted some 45 minutes, ensuring the smooth and reliable two-way transmission of sound and images between the taikonauts in orbit and the ground audience.It demands long-term and continuous monitoring and control over the China Space Station to realize the space classroom lecture. However, due to the curvature of the Earth, it is difficult for a traditional ground station to meet such requirements, Shan Changsheng, chief engineer with the Beijing center, explained.""Thanks to the relay satellites that are covering a bigger range with higher transmission speed, we could not only manage that but also support taikonauts' video and voice calls with the ground and their use of Wi-Fi inside the space station cabin,"" Shan said. In 2013, the first-generation relay satellite network with three satellites supported China's first space lecture and starting from 2021, two generations of relay satellites have successfully supported three events in the Tiangong Classroom lecture series, according to the Beijing center. The Tiangong Classroom lecture series, taking place episode after episode, shows the growing strength of China's space technology, and witnesses the advancement of China's space-based space monitoring and control industry, Shan noted.

Only when they complete the T-shape basic structure, can the power supply, information and thermal control systems deliver their best performances and support relatively larger experiments,"" Bai Linhou, deputy chief designer from the space station system at the China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST), told the Global Times, explaining why the feat was of great significance in the overall building of the China Space Station.After completing the building of the China Space Station, six taikonauts of two Shenzhou manned spaceflight crews will carry out the first-ever direct handover in orbit.The Guided Navigation and Control System (GNC), developed by Institute 502 of the CAST, played a crucial role in addressing two major challenges the Mengtian module faced during the docking maneuver, said Song Mingchao, chief designer of the space station lab modules.The power generated by the Mengtian's solar panels was not enough to make up for the energy used in the process, meaning that if the maneuver could not be completed within the designated time, the automated rendezvous and docking process would have to be called off, and the attitude of the Mengtian would need to be changed to let it face the Sun to generate power, which was the first and most dangerous challenge, according to Song.Another challenge was that since the earlier modules had formed an L-shape asymmetric combination, it increased the difficulty in controlling the combination's attitude.Technicians at the CAST formulated special emergency response plans to cope with any malfunction during the process, and the GNC system accurately identified the relative attitude between the Mengtian and the Tianhe-Wentian combination, ensuring the success of the ""space kiss.""The successful docking of the Mengtian proved again the high reliability of China's space technology, the CAST institute said. The Mengtian, weighing more than 23 tons at launch, was the heaviest spacecraft China has ever launched. According to Liu Guoning, deputy chief designer of the scientific cabinet system at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)' Technology and Engineering Center for Space Utilization, it will be China's largest comprehensive space experiment platform within the next decade.The CAS loaded eight scientific experiment cabinets inside the Mengtian module, covering fields including the basic physics of microgravity, space materials science, microgravity fluid physics as well as combustion science, Liu revealed.The CAS scheduled some 40 scientific experimental projects in these fields, and they will be carried out in accordance with the overall plan. Liu said that ""the scientific experiments set to be carried out inside the Mengtian lab module are expected to enable scientists to conduct cutting-edge studies and get world-class findings."" According to the Shanghai Academy of Spacecraft Technology, the main contractor and developer of the Mengtian module, there are 13 scientific cabinets inside the craft to hold scientific equipment. It also carries 37 extravehicular payload installation sites capable of carrying scientific experiments that need to be exposed to the space environment, cosmic rays, vacuum and solar winds.For the first time in China's aerospace history, the Mengtian carries a subsystem for short message communication services empowered by the home-developed BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS). According to mission insiders, the subsystem comprises short message receiving and sending antenna and applications that are installed on portable terminals held by the taikonauts. It is the first-time application and testing of the BDS system in the China Space Station.The subsystem will allow taikonauts to communicate with their families with short messages and voice messages at any time, and it will also serve as an emergency link with the ground when other communication routes malfunction.Bai revealed that the China Space Station is drafting cooperation standards for rendezvous and docking as well as payload installation onboard.""The China Space Station will always be an open platform for global cooperation, and China is drafting cooperation standards, for rendezvous, docking and payload installation, which will be released to the whole world,"" Bai noted.

Only when they complete the T-shape basic structure, can the power supply, information and thermal control systems deliver their best performances and support relatively larger experiments,"" Bai Linhou, deputy chief designer from the space station system at the China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST), told the Global Times.The T-shape basic structure of the China Space Station with all module cabins on the same plane, could greatly increase the supporting capabilities for the application payload on board, Wu Jun, chief designer of the Mengtian lab module with the Shanghai Academy of Spacecraft Technology (SAST), told the Global Times.The symmetrical T-shape design could also be the center of mass for the China Space Station, to be well-placed in the middle of the combination, which would reduce both the difficulty and energy consumption of flight control, Pang Zhihao, a Beijing-based space expert, told the Global Times on Thursday. The T-shape design is of great safety value, Pang said. The two airlock cabins are located at the far ends of the combination and on the same plane, so events like a normal pressure relief or an abnormal isolation at one end would not affect the space inside other cabins.The T-shape design would also enable the giant solar panels installed at the ends of the two lab modules to face the Sun, regardless of the flight attitude of the space station, Pang added.Just like the Wentian lab module, the Mengtian took the power solution into consideration to prepare for more demanding in-orbit experiments. The Mengtian is also equipped with giant flexible solar panels, each of which can extend some 138 square meters. Both the Wentian and Mengtian cabins are equipped with Sun orientation devices and driving mechanisms. With the combined motion of two degrees of freedom, the pairs of solar wings on the two lab modules would rotate synchronously, ensuring that they face the Sun like sunflowers all the way in the China Space Station's flight in orbit.After the completion of the T-shape China Space Station, two pairs of such solar panels on the Wentian and Mengtian modules could together generate nearly 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per day, equivalent to the half-year consumption of a household.According to the SAST, this means that the space station needn't worry about electricity.According to CCTV on Thursday, the third batch of taikonauts, including 17 men and one woman, are expected to begin executing space station missions starting from 2023. The third batch of taikonauts has seven space pilots, seven flight engineers and four payload experts. China has started the selection process for the fourth batch of taikonauts to join future missions, the CMSA disclosed in early October. Twelve to 14 candidates are expected to be chosen, including seven or eight pilots. Engineers as well as payload experts will also be selected to join the force, the CMSA said. The posts of payload experts are also open to applicants from the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions for the first time.                         "

Later, the Wentian conducted its transposition and then docked with the side port of the space station's node cabin. The Wentian's transposition took about one hour, according to the CMSA.Yi Zhikun, chief designer of the manned space product department of the Shanghai Academy of Spacecraft Technology (SAST,) the main contractor and developer of the Mengtian lab module, told the Global Times that the Mengtian's transposition, just like the Wentian's operation, will involve similar stages such as the unlocking and separation of the lab module from the core module's forward port, and the berthing, locking and sealing with the side port after the transposition to form a two-way passage between the modules.""Only when the three modules complete their assembly and form the T-shape structure in orbit, can we declare that we have achieved all preset goals.

Particularly, the cooperation in vaccine has always been at the forefront of the world.China was the first country to cooperate with Indonesia in the research and development of vaccines and specific medicines for COVID-19. China has also supported Indonesia in establishing a regional vaccine production center and is one of the largest suppliers of COVID-19 vaccines to Indonesia. Meanwhile, Indonesia was also one of the first countries to provide material assistance to China after the COVID-19 outbreak.So far, COVID-19 vaccines of multiple Chinese companies including Sinovac Biotech, China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CanSinoBIO and BioKangtai have been approved for use in Indonesia.Sinovac has supplied more than 280 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine to Indonesia including over 130 million doses exported as semi-finished products, the Global Times learned from the company.BioKangtai started production of the adenovirus vector vaccine for COVID-19 in February of 2021, and the vaccine was approved for emergency use in Indonesia on October 31, 2021. The company signed a purchase agreement on the vaccine with an Indonesian partner in November 2021. Over 30 million doses of the company's adenovirus vector vaccine were exported to Indonesia in 2021.In March this year, CanSinoBIO's adenovirus type-5 vector-based COVID-19 vaccine (Ad5-nCoV) was approved by BPOM Indonesia as booster shots following inactivated vaccine, while CNBG's inactivated vaccine, which had previously been approved as emergency use in Indonesia, was also approved there in March as a heterologous booster.Apart from the cooperation in the combat against COVID-19 between the two countries, Chinese and Indonesian experts and scientists of TB and respiratory infectious diseases also discussed and shared their latest research results on the elimination of TB with innovative vaccine technologies during a forum in Bali on Wednesday.The technology used in CanSinoBio's adenovirus vector vaccine can also be used in the TB vaccine, the company said at the forum.Imran Pambudi, National TB Program Manager and Deputy Director of Tuberculosis Prevention and Control at the Ministry of Health of Indonesia, thinks highly of the contribution made by CanSinoBio in the research and development of inhaled TB vaccine and the achievements made by the cooperation between China and Indonesia in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic.Global Times                         "

Some neighborhoods in Beijing’s Fengtai have already launched at home self-testing.The city of Ordos in Inner Mongolia and Xinxiang in Henan Province have also trialed self-testing in different forms. Residents can test at home through the collection swabs issued by neighborhood officials, or they can collect themselves at the nucleic acid testing stations located in and around residential compounds.A resident from Inner Mongolia told the media that local residents can obtain cotton swabs at nucleic acid testing stations, and that health officials will help place the swabs into the sample tube after the residents complete their own sampling.“There are workers on site to guide sampling which is fast and convenient, and it also avoids time wasting and risk of cross-infection,” said a resident who had used the service.Several neighborhoods in Beijing’s Fengtai began distributing testing reagents to residents early in the morning. “We started distributing sampling tubes at 9:30 am, and collect completed samples at 15:00 pm in the afternoon,” a community worker said.“The implementation of self-sampling is mainly in consideration of groups who have limited mobility,” a community worker told the media. “The service is focused on providing convenience to children and seniors.”In addition, more than 300 new nucleic acid sampling machines appeared on the streets of Henan Province’s Xinxiang mainlyin shopping malls, supermarkets, schools and other public places.These units can carry out testing using a cotton swab to wipe the back of the throat, after the device issued a ""test passed"" prompt, individuals place the cotton swabs into a waiting test tube.This kind of machine only needs people to open their mouths at the unit following disinfection and temperature measurement, with a cotton swab to wipe their throats. “This type of test is more suitable for younger people,” a Xinxiang resident noted.However, some experts also have doubts about whether this measure could be effective. “Nucleic acid testing has a series of collection procedures and specifications, and even some professionally trained medical staff cannot meet the full standards,” a Guangzhou-based medical expert told the Global Times on Sunday.It is debatable whether requiring these residents to take a self-sampling of nucleic acid without any symptoms would be effective in detecting infections, Yang Zhanqiu, a professor of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times.Global Times                          "

Guessing lantern riddles, watching lantern parades and eating glutinous rice balls were some of the most common means to celebrate the traditional festival across the country.An important part of the Spring Festival, the Lantern Festival has much more meaning than family reunion, more importantly it is regarded as a carnival of sorts for people to welcome the arrival of spring.Over the past week, the search for keywords such as ""lantern festival"" and ""lantern exhibitions"" on Chinese travel ticketing platforms such as Ctrip, Meituan, Mafengwo, and Fliggy saw a sharp increase. The number of related searches on Ctrip has doubled compared with the same period in 2022 as the economy has been trending toward recovery across the country this year.In addition, to keep up with demand from tourists as they flocked to the public venues to celebrate the day, countless public venues across the country opened night tours to bring lantern exhibitions and fireworks shows to crowds.In Central China's Hubei Province, the Hubei Provincial Museum launched its first night tour on Sunday evening. Visitors could not only look at lanterns under the moonlight, but also appreciate a music concert performed using a bianzhong, a set of musical bells used to play music in ancient times.In Shanghai, the centuries-old Yu Garden is famous for its exquisite layout, beautiful scenery and annual lantern exhibitions. As 2023 is the Year of the Rabbit, the Yu Garden has introduced a traditional Chinese myth exhibition based on The Classic of Mountains and Seas that combines ancient lantern art and AR technology to bring exhibits to people's mobile phones.In addition to lantern exhibitions, over in Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province, the Hangzhou Fireworks Show returned on Sunday evening after an 11-year hiatus to celebrate the festival and the 2022 Asian Games, which were delayed to September of this year.People were full of undisguised anticipation for this visual feast on the night of the Lantern Festival: ""The river-view rooms on the night [of the Lantern Festival] were booked long ago,"" a home-stay owner told the Global Times, ""Many people have asked for rooms with the best angle to watch the fireworks, but clearly we can't guarantee that since we don't exactly where they're going to be set off.""The custom of lighting lanterns during the festival began in the Han Dynasty (206BC-AD220). During the Tang Dynasty (618-907), lantern appreciation activities became more extravagant as they were hung everywhere in the palace and on the streets.In areas where traditions are well protected, local customs have been passed down for generations.For example, at a fish lantern exhibition in Wangmantian village, Huizhou, East Chinas' Anhui Province, young people walk through alleyways holding fish lanterns as the sound of nearby firecrackers echoes of the walls. ""Through the courtesy of the fast communication across social media, many customs, including the fish lantern exhibition, have become much talked about topics online as the people who have enjoyed them post about them. While the festival atmosphere has reached its peak, it is also an excellent inheritance of folk customs,"" Deng Xiaoxiao, a cultural custom expert told the Global Times on Sunday.

It set out on January 17 to the South China Sea, then voyaged through fierce winter winds and waves across the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea before arriving in Liaodong Bay. The ship was built in the 1980s as an icebreaking anchor-handling tug supply vessel (AHTS) for BeauDrill, the drilling subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources, and was acquired by Sun Yat-sen University in 2021.Although the ship is more than 40 years old and hasn't been in operation for nearly two years, it is still in good condition in terms of the ship's body structure and power system. ""We have carried out repair and conversion works to some of its cabins and added research equipment and appliances to make it meet the requirements for cruises in the polar region and for scientific explorations. The sea trials were to verify the results of such improvements,"" Cheng Xiao, chief scientist for the icebreaker's maiden journey, told the Global Times. ""It was one lucky journey for us, as we encountered the fiercest cold front this winter. The Bohai Bay ice covered a vast area and was consistent, and the temperature came to as low as -20C, accompanied by a strong wind, which provided a perfect polar-like experiment environment for the icebreaker, fully verifying its icebreaking capability as well as scientific service capacity,"" Cheng, who is also a professor with the university's School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, noted.  The 1,500-nautical-mile journey across four seas tested and verified the ship's long-distance operation capability and also verified that it possesses a world-leading icebreaking capability at PC4 (Polar Class-4), Cheng said. Sun Yat-sen University has equipped the icebreaker with a range of scientific chambers including the oceanic physics lab and chemistry lab. Many of the scientific appliances onboard are domestically developed, and their performance is just as good as foreign-made equipment, which is another characteristic of the icebreaker, Yuan Yuan, an associate professor with the university's School of Geospatial Engineering and Science, and a member of the first crew batch of the icebreaker, told the Global Times. More appliance installation and renovation work is expected to be carried out before the ship sets out for further trials, Yuan revealed. The icebreaker, with a length of 78.95 meters and a width of 17.22 meters, has a displacement of 5,852 tons and a draft of 8.16 meters. It was converted and renovated at the Guangzhou Wenchong Dockyard, a subsidiary of the Guangzhou Shipyard International Co. Limited under the China State Shipbuilding Corporation Group.The cost of conversion and renovation stands at more than 100 million yuan, as per the university. Different from the members of national team of  and -2, Zhao, who participated in the 36th Antarctic expedition, noted that the university's ownership of the new icebreaker could facilitate scientific exchange and cooperation with global researchers, despite the ever-changing international situation. Sun Yat-sen University is the leading force in the Chinese university alliance for polar region research. The   is projected to be a common science and research platform for universities.So far, more than a dozen of the most prestigious Chinese universities including Tsinghua University, Tongji University, Wuhan University, and Dalian Ocean University have participated in the program. And in the future, more journeys aboard the   will be scheduled according to the universities' specific research goals, Cheng revealed.   is also expected to join forces with China's  and -2 icebreakers in the future. As China's independently developed polar icebreaker and scientific research vessel, -2 is 122.5 meters long and 22.32 meters wide, with a designed displacement of 13,996 tons. It can continuously break ice as thick as 1.5 meters at a speed of 2 knots (3.70 kilometers per hour) to 3 knots.According to Cheng, , which was procured from Ukraine in 1993, is more suited for a cargo vessel role in polar exploration. Although  and -2 have already formed a dream team for the country's polar quest, generally speaking, China's polar region entry capability is relatively weak.The chances of expeditions to the polar region provided by the two ""snow dragons"" are still very scarce, which to a great extent limits their research capabilities and depth of research, Cheng said. China has so far conducted 39 Antarctic scientific explorations since the first in 1984 and 12 Arctic quests since the first in 1999, accumulating rich scientific experience through survey findings, and has formed a research matrix of ""two vessels, seven research stations, and one polar fixed-wing aircraft."" Insiders have told the Global Times that China is still in the second tier when it comes to polar science and research capability, and that there is a gap between China and advanced countries such as the US and certain European countries. There could be more than 4,000 personnel stationed at one US Antarctic station every year, but our research vessels can only bring slightly over 200 to the region each year. The difference in sheer manpower is huge, one of the insiders told the Global Times. Although China has issued national reports on the polar situation in the Antarctic and Arctic, data used by Chinese scientists is primarily sourced from foreign peers, and the amount of original data is too scarce to match China's status as an international science and research power, Cheng admitted. It would be an urgent task for the country to innovate and improve its polar entry capabilities. Only when we can attain more first-hand observation, can we better participate in polar governance, build a community with a shared future, and have a better say in international affairs related to polar affairs, Cheng said. The emergence of the   will hopefully improve the situation. ""It has a smaller tonnage at half that of the -2 and only a quarter of the , which gives it better agility. It also possesses better self-sustainability than  and -2,"" Cheng explained. If we can fully harness its advantages and form a strong fleet with , -2, as well as the  Shan Da Xue large research vessel [which is capable of cruising in the low ice concentration sea areas], we can greatly boost our research capability in the polar and near-polar regions, Cheng said. Xie Peng, the vice director of the Sun Yat-sen University's polar research center, told the Global Times that we can learn about climate change and glacier melting among other issues through polar research, which are also crucial fields for international cooperation and will benefit mankind as a whole. ""Polar capability is also listed as one of the main fields in national security together with homeland security, deep sea security, and outer space security.""

She urged schools at all levels to implement and optimize relevant COVID-19 prevention management and fully restore the normal operation of teaching activities. The health of students and teaching staff as well as the safety of campuses must be ensured, Sun stressed. Before the start of the semester, schools should do thorough research on how many students and teachers had been infected and organize their return in an orderly manner. School hospitals should prepare medications in advance and monitor the health status of personnel within the campus, Sun noted. With regard to the mental health of students and teachers due to the impact of COVID-19, she urged more attention and education be given in this regard. Schools should carry out leisure activities based on the characteristics of different age groups so as to create a more positive atmosphere. ""No nucleic acid tests, no health codes, everything is returning to normal!

However, body temperature checks and face masks are still required. A teacher from Qibao Wenlai School in Shanghai surnamed Tang said that there are no particular requirements for epidemic prevention in his school and wearing a mask is no longer mandatory. ""Both teachers and students are looking forward to the new semester when face-to-face education can be carried out normally. We hope the situation can completely return to the pre-epidemic period so that the impact of the epidemic on education activities could be minimized,"" Tang said. In the latest guidebook on epidemic prevention and control issued by the State Council, schools that have not reported COVID-19 infections can restore on-site teaching normally. Health monitoring will be conducted for seven consecutive days after students and faculty return to campus, and schools should minimize gatherings. Higher education institutions will no longer conduct nucleic acid screening for all members, but will conduct nucleic acid or antigen testing for key personnel engaged in catering, logistics, security and cleaning on campus, the guidebook said. Students and teachers at various levels of educational institutions are no longer required to provide nucleic acid test results in order to enter or leave the campus, it added. To prevent the potential spread of the virus, schools must stockpile drugs for COVID-19 infection treatment regularly and prepare sufficient antigen tests, masks and other medical materials. Zhuang Shilihe, a Guangzhou-based medical expert, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the risk of a large influx of students bringing in new waves of infection is relatively low. The biggest risk with the largest scale of personnel flows happened during the Spring Festival holidays and the period passed smoothly without bringing in a new spike.

Also, the need for nucleic acid testing for mainland tourists was lifted the same day. But the current services are restricted to residents of the two small islands, mainland spouses of Taiwan residents, and students studying in the two islands, media reports said.On December 22, 2022, Taiwan authorities announced that it would allow a limited reopening of ferry links, with a maximum of one ferry trip a day from Kinmen to Xiamen and no more than two trips per week from the Matsu to Fuzhou, Fujian Province, from January 7 to February 6.The ferry services still exclude businesspeople from the Taiwan region, triggering a strong backlash.James Wu, president of the Xiamen-based Taiwan business association, said what the Taiwan authorities have done is not only discriminatory but insulting to mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople. Wu said they would use their votes to punish the Taiwan authorities.Regional lawmaker Chen Yu-Jen from Kinmen, also a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party, criticized the DPP authorities for not showing sincerity in promoting the normalization of cross-Straits ferry services, which would cast a shadow over the recent signs of cross-Straits detente once again, media reported.Considering the past moves by the DDP authorities to block cross-Straits exchanges, it is likely to be a ""bumpy and tortuous"" process to fully resume the cross-Straits ferries and direct flights as well as other exchanges, said Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies and director of the Center for Taiwan Studies at Fudan University. To further push forward cross-Straits exchanges depends on whether the DPP authorities really care about people's welfare after the mainland has continued to show goodwill to facilitate the cross-Straits exchanges, Xin told the Global Times on Tuesday.Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen has always stigmatized and demonized exchanges between the two sides as the re-warming of cross-Straits ties goes against her intention of seeking ""Taiwan secession,"" Xin said.He said DPP authorities, which are trying to use cross-Straits exchange issues as a political bargaining chip, have deviated from the mainstream public opinion in the region, which is likely to affect their votes in the regional election campaign.As of Monday, the latest public polls with more than 34,000 respondents in the Taiwan region showed that about 80 percent of the respondents said it should reopen the door for mainland tourists to Taiwan soon.

It is 4,718 meters above sea level, and is also the third-largest saltwater lake in China, providing a habitat for protected species and abundant natural scenery.In the 1990s, archaeologists investigated the petroglyphs around the lake, many of which are considered to be remains of the Tubo period (633-842) in the 7th century, and most of them were religious-related themes.In August 2021, a team of experts who have been engaged in archaeological research on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau for a long time formed the Namtso scientific expedition team, and they studied the ancient petroglyphs, ancient ruins, and ancient tombs in the area. The Namtso nature reserve was established in 2001, playing an important role in protecting the unique natural landscape and geological relics in the area, as well as maintaining regional biodiversity. With the social and economic development of the surrounding areas, the protection of the ecological environment in the reserve is facing increasing pressure.In January 5, 2023, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration noted that the Xizang government will roll out an ""adjustment project"" to balance the relationship between economic development and ecological protection.

The data shows that the number of marriage registrations hit a new high in Hangzhou, while the average age of marriage has been pushed back to 30 in many cities. According to the Hangzhou Civil Affairs Bureau, a total of 65,315 marriages were registered in the city in 2022, including 65,109 marriages by mainland residents and 206 marriages involving residents from the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, the island of Taiwan, overseas Chinese and foreigners.The number of marriage registrations in Hangzhou increased by 5,488 over 2021, hitting a record high in four years. It is worth noting that Hangzhou was selected as the ""happiest city in China"" in 2022. Meanwhile, 17,027 divorces were registered in 2022, up 2.5 percent year on year. According to the Bureau, when it comes to the age difference between married couples, it is still the dominant trend that men are one to four years older than women, but the percentage of women who get married to younger men continues to rise. In 2022, 21,438 marriages and 6,971 divorces were registered in Changzhou, according to data released by the city's Civil Affairs Bureau. The number of marriages fell compared to 2021, with 289 fewer, and the number of divorces increased, with 298 more.

The site conducted the last full-system integrated exercise for its search and rescue mission on Thursday.The drill on Thursday further tested the site's organizational and implementation capabilities for spacecraft search and rescue missions. Currently, all special working groups at the landing site are ready to receive the return of Shenzhou-14.Shenzhou-14 is the last mission of the three-step development strategy of China's manned space project, as well as the final episode of the construction stage of the China Space Station.The fact that they will return at night time involves higher requirements for on-site rescue and risk prevention, the Global Times learned, as it would be more difficult to locate and reach the ship at night.To prepare for the successful completion of the return, the landing site worked on a situation with the maximum of hardship, complexity, coldness and darkness, and made various plans for spacecraft tracking, return capsule recovery, and on-site rescue for astronauts.A number of materials have been prepared including lighting and winter supplies. Training for extreme situations has also been carried out to ensure they can handle any kind of emergency during the process.Early on Wednesday morning, six taikonauts of the Shenzhou-14 and -15 missions had their historic gathering in the China Space Station, marking a first in China's aerospace history, after the Shenzhou-15 manned spacecraft was launched on Tuesday night.The new faces of Shenzhou-15 will conduct a direct handover in orbit with their predecessors, which will take about five days, during which the Shenzhou-14 crew members will mainly prepare for their return to Earth, while the Shenzhou-15 crew will focus on setting up the space station's working status, adapting to the space environment and concluding the handover.Sitting atop a Long March-2F Y14 carrier rocket and carrying Chen Dong, Liu Yang and Cai Xuzhe - the third crew to enter China's Tianhe space station core module - Shenzhou-14 was launched on June 5 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.Six months later, the Shenzhou-14 members have achieved a number of firsts, including the first in-orbit docking of two 20-ton space modules, the first time taikonauts entered the Wentian and Mengtian lab modules, and the first two-hour fast autonomous docking of a cargo spaceship.According to Ji Qiming, spokesperson for the China Manned Space Agency, they have completed a variety of tasks. The crew coordinated with the ground to finish building the basic structure of the T-shaped space station. They have also undergone nine combo configurations, five rendezvous and docking maneuvers, two separations, and two translocation missions.The Shenzhou-14 crew have also managed a large number of platform tests, as well as equipment maintenance and other tasks onboard the space station. They completed the unlocking and installation of experiment cabinets in two lab modules, and carried out a number of scientific and technical experiments as well as one ""Tiangong classroom"" space lecture.

The number of newborns in the city in 2022 was 32,409, and the number of deaths was 34,315, leading to a negative natural growth rate of population of minus 0.38 per thousand. The newborns in the city dropped greatly from 43,024 in 2021 to 32,409 in 2022. In the Dazu district of Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, the population of registered households amounted to 1.06 million as of the end of 2022, with 3,456 newborns and 8,380 deaths, causing a negative natural growth rate of the population of minus 4.6 per thousand. Newborns of 3,456 in the district in 2022 dropped by more than half from 2021 and widened the extent of negative population growth. The natural growth rate of population in the district in 2021 was minus 1.2 per thousand. Statistics from Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Southwest China's Yunnan Province show that the birth rates and natural growth rate of the registered population continued to decline in 2022. The population in the Chinese mainland fell for the first time in 61 years, a decline of 850,000 in 2022, data released in January by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) showed. There are two reasons for population declines in a region, He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""The first one is that the natural population growth rate is negative, that is, the birth rate is lower than the death rate. The second is that as the outflow of population is greater than the inflow, the migration of a population is negative.""It is not surprising that multiple places recorded negative natural population growth rates in 2022, as the national population growth was negative last year, He said, noting that policies to ease the cost of childcare are urgently needed to change the momentum. Shenzhen in South China's Guangdong Province, one of China's megacities with a population of 17.68 million, started in January to solicit public opinions on the city's policy of childcare subsidies. The subsidies for ""third child"" families can be accumulated up to 19,000 yuan ($2,789) over the course of three years. Besides Shenzhen, Jinan in East China's Shandong Province released a plan to improve the fertility policy and promote long-term and balanced population development. According to the plan, families with a second or third child born since January 1, 2023 can access a childcare subsidy of 600 yuan per month for each child up to the age of 3. However, the decline of population in the Chinese mainland does not mean that the populations of all provinces in the country also fell. The population development is uneven among different regions. On the whole, birth rates are lower in the eastern and northern regions than in the western and southern regions.At least five provinces and regions such as Jiangxi, Guagnxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Chongqing recorded positive growth of permanent residents.Meanwhile, Chinese demographers stressed that the negative growth for the mainland population does not mean that China's demographic dividend has come to an end.The impact of negative population growth on socio-economic and environmental resources is essentially neutral, since China's overall population quality, especially in terms of education, is rapidly growing, so China can maintain a stable and sustainable economic development by improving the quality of labor and seizing the opportunity of technological revolution to increase productivity in spite of the overall decrease in labor resources, Peng Xizhe, director of the Fudan University Center for Population and Development Policy Studies, told the Global Times. Chinese experts pointed out that China's demographic dividend will continue to provide a strong driving force for the domestic economy and huge opportunities.                          "

The ECMO machine is similar to a heart-lung bypass machine used in open-heart surgery. It pumps and oxygenates a patient's blood from outside the body, allowing the heart and lungs to rest. The whole machine, called Huisheng-I ECMO, weighs about 7.5 kilograms, less than half the weight of similar foreign products, so it can better meet the emergency and transport needs of critically ill patients.ECMO is an important part of life support for patients, as well as an important treatment means to gain time for them. However, the technical threshold is high, as is the price, and the key core technologies have previously been monopolized by a few multinational medical device enterprises.The development of China's ECMO system has broken the monopoly of foreign enterprises, improved the access to advanced life support equipment in China, and significantly reduced the price of the product, which is conducive to reducing the burden of medical treatment for patients.""The technology of the product is independent and controllable, with completely independent intellectual property rights,"" Zeng Si, the director of the ECMO research project, said on Wednesday. ""The overall performance and indicators reach the level of similar international products; some indicators are even better than similar products,"" Zeng noted.The core technology of the ECMO system is derived from a rocket servo system, Zeng said. The servo system is made up of many components, involving mechanical, electronic, fluid and other items, and because it works in a small space, it has to be highly integrated and lightweight.Du Bin, deputy commander of the ECMO project and vice president of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, said that when the ECMO project was established in 2020, the hospital joined the technical team, which was mainly responsible for the design and implementation of animal experiments and clinical trials. In the early stage of research, the hospital led clinical colleagues to put forward clinical needs, benchmarked foreign products and put forward suggestions on product model details.In the animal experiment stage, the hospital took the lead in designing and establishing long-term ECMO supporting animal models in cooperation with sibling units, which realized long-term operation of more than 14 days. The successful development of Huisheng-I ECMO is the result of collaborative innovation between the medical and technological industry, experts said.

The Global Times learnt that the local tourism industry will gradually recover and it may fully return to its normal prosperity around summer time.It is estimated that the number of visits received by the prefecture throughout the year will reach 200 million.At the beginning of the new year, the whole region achieved a ""good start"" in attracting investment, with new project signings exceeding 80 billion yuan ($11.78 billion). The total value of foreign trade this year is expected to reach 49.31 billion yuan ($7.26 billion), accounting for 20 percent of Xinjiang's total foreign trade value.The pandemic reached its peak in the prefecture from December 25, 2022 to January 1, 2023, and then continued to show a downward trend. As of Wednesday, the rate for positive COVID-19 infections is below 1 percent.""The intensity of the epidemic is gradually flattening, and the epidemic situation is generally stable,"" the epidemic command center said.In the past three years, Kashi has frequently been hit by waves of the pandemic, which often brought the region back to quasi-lockdown mode, resulting in closure of businesses and suspension of classes.With COVID-19 effectively contained and pro-growth incentives in place, hospitality businesses across China are seeing vitality return to areas once hit by the epidemic.

Society,By GT staff reporters  |  2023/2/9 22:32:24,New wave of mass COVID infections 'unlikely to occur' in coming months,"Chinese health officials and experts said on Thursday that the nationwide COVID-19 situation has generally become stable. Although a new wave of mass infections is unlikely to occur in the coming months, schools and rural areas will be the next priority for epidemic control. 

China has just gone through a nationwide outbreak, from which most people have recovered while some are still recovering, said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), at Thursday's news conference. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-15/550510ab-3bf5-4171-873b-36ec9ec1c09f.jpeg," Chinese health officials and experts said on Thursday that the nationwide COVID-19 situation has generally become stable. Although a new wave of mass infections is unlikely to occur in the coming months, schools and rural areas will be the next priority for epidemic control. China has just gone through a nationwide outbreak, from which most people have recovered while some are still recovering, said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), at Thursday's news conference. ""The overall immunity of the population is at a relatively high level,"" said Wu, noting that it is unlikely that a new wave of mass infections will occur in the coming months. It is also less likely that there will be another similar large-scale COVID-19 outbreak in China again, said the top epidemiologist.""As China optimizes its prevention and control policy, it is likely that other COVID-19 outbreaks will occur intermittently in certain areas, among some populations, and over time in the future,"" he said. ""But there is little possibility of a nationwide mass epidemic with rapid spread within a short period of time.""In January, Wu said on his Sina Weibo account that about 80 percent of the population in China had been infected with COVID-19.Lu Hongzhou, head of the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, also believed that another major COVID-19 epidemic is unlikely to occur in China within six months. ""Previous studies have shown that cellular immune function is still generally high at about seven months after infection,"" he told the Global Times. According to the press conference, data show that since January 1, 39 evolutionary branches have been monitored from various ports of entry to China, all of which are Omicron mutant strains, dominated by BA.5.2 and BF.7. Currently, no epidemic of new mutant strains with significantly increased transmission, immune escape capacity and pathogenicity has been detected in the country.Experts also said that the likelihood of the future emergence of a more infectious mutant or one with enhanced pathogenicity is also very low.At the news conference, schools and rural areas were highlighted as the key areas for the next stage of outbreak prevention and control.As the national epidemic situation is generally stable, schools have clarified their anti-COVID policies and prepared for students to return for the spring semester. Schools nationwide are expected to be able to achieve the scheduled, normal and safe start of classes, said Liu Peijun, an official of the Ministry of Education, during Thursday's news conference. The opening days of primary and secondary schools for the spring semester are mainly during February 1 to 15, while universities will mainly start between February 1 and 28. If no risk of an epidemic is detected, students won't delay their return to school, said Liu. Education departments used the winter break to make plans for anti-COVID measures, proposing various support programs, including formulating a general plan for school epidemic prevention and control based on the new regulations, conducting research and supervision, strengthening departmental coordination for health monitoring of teachers and students, and following up on health services, he said. Universities across the country have established on-campus health posts to provide health monitoring for those infected on campus.On Monday, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan . She urged schools at all levels to implement and optimize relevant COVID-19 prevention management and fully restore the normal operation of teaching activities. Another area that was highlighted was rural areas. Administrators of villages are requested to contact key populations such as the elderly, disabled and pregnant women to monitor their health dynamics in a timely manner, according to officials from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. They stressed the importance of integrating epidemic prevention and control with spring farming.Remote mountains, forests, pastoral areas and islands are also areas that need special attention. In these areas, officials will increase drug stockpiles and expand the form of services, such as providing online consultations.COVID-19 antibody testing has recently been conducted in several cities of China. Officials from the National Health Commission said this was done to measure specific antibody levels in various age groups, and urban and rural populations, to obtain the ""immune background"" of the population, estimate the level of antibodies in the entire population, and estimate the level of cross-protection against different mutant strains, as well as project the level of infection in the population.Compared with schools, China's vast rural areas can be more vulnerable and at risk. Although adolescents and the elderly groups are both now widely infected, the immune protection that occurs after natural infection in adolescents is usually better, so the likelihood of a mass infection with student clusters is unlikely for half a year or even longer, Lu explained.

Outstanding talent could get travel endorsement with the validity period of five years, and qualified talent from the scientific, education and health sectors could get three-year endorsement, while the one from the legal and other sectors could get one-year endorsement, according to the authorities. They may travel to and from Hong Kong and Macao SARs several times within the validity period, and stay in Hong Kong and Macao SARs for no more than 30 days each time. Excellent talents can submit the applications to any immigration management authority above the county-level in the Greater Bay Area.Currently, for individual travel endorsement, a qualified applicant can stay in Hong Kong or Macao SARs no more than seven days for each application.Lin Jiang, a professor from Lingnan College at Sun Yat-sen University, sees the new policy as holding ""significant meaning"" in boosting the development of the Greater Bay Area. ""It provides great convenience for mainland talents to communicate with those in Hong Kong and Macao SARs,"" Lin told the Global Times on Thursday.The policy will boost the personnel communication, which will facilitate further integration across the Greater Bay Area, Lin said. It also helps to expand cooperation across various sectors including scientific and technology research as well as business partnerships, according to Lin.Meanwhile, the convenience will be beneficial for Hong Kong and Macao SARs in attracting high-end talents too, Lin said.A resident surnamed Liang from the city of Shunde, South China's Guangdong Province, who graduated from a university in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Thursday that the new policy is a positive development and that she looks forward more incentive policies to further improve the young talent networking and connectivity across the Greater Bay Area.After working in HKSAR for two years, Liang returned to her hometown Shunde in 2020 for an attractive new role. After the mainland fully resumed normal travel with the Hong Kong and Macao SARs on February 6, many residents like Liang in the Greater Bay Area hope to see more communication and an accelerated economic recovery. In a survey conducted by Bank of China Hong Kong and the local media through an online questionnaire among 2,722 respondents aged 18 and above from January 9 to 15, nearly 80 percent of the respondents plan to travel and visit relatives in the Greater Bay Area after fully resumption of travel between the mainland and the HKSAR. Many respondents also expressed their intention to open bank accounts for leisure consumption and daily payments in the mainland, according to local media reports.                          "

It’s also less likely that another large-scale epidemic like this one will emerge in the future, with the optimization of prevention and control strategies, Wu noted.Since China started managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B  instead of Class A infectious diseases on January 8, the optimized measures against the epidemic remain effective for timely detection and effective control of the epidemic, said Wu.In the past three years, in response to the constantly changing situation of the epidemic, China has issued 10 editions of COVID-19 control protocols, and avoided the large-scale spreading of the original strain and Delta strain with strong pathogenicity, reducing deaths and severe illness from COVID-19, according to Wu.Compared with three years ago, the pathogenicity of the Omicron strain has significantly weakened. We have more knowledge of the virus and have more types of antiviral drugs as well as more experience in treating COVID-19 with traditional Chinese medicine  and Western medicine, Wu noted.

Over the past two years, Tianwen-1 has obtained first-hand detection data and achieved notable scientific research results, which analysts believed would be continued with further multi-dimensional exploration missions carrying out.After a journey of 470 million kilometers, Tianwen-1 probe entered orbit around Mars on February 10, 2021, becoming China's first satellite to achieve this feat. According to the China National Space Administration (CNSA), the Tianwen-1 mission will explore the surface and geology of the Mars as well as its soil composition and magnetic field.Three months after it entered Mars orbit, on May 15, 2021, Tianwen-1 probe touched down at its pre-selected landing area in Utopia Planitia, a vast Martian plain, marking the first time that China has landed a probe on the planet. A week later on May 22, 2021, the Mars rover Zhurong, which resembles a butterfly, drove down from its landing platform to the Martian surface. On June 11, the China National Space Administration released the first photographs taken by Zhurong.Before landing on Mars, the orbiter acquired panchromatic images of the pre-selected landing area with a resolution of exceeding 1m, wide-area color medium resolution images, and multispectral information. After landing on Mars, the Mars Orbiter conducted imaging exploration of the landing area and the rover's patrol area to obtain high-resolution images.On June 29, 2022, the CNSA announced that the Mars Orbiter has acquired medium resolution image data covering the entire Martian globe, acquiring a large amount of first-hand scientific data and accumulating valuable experience for China's planetary exploration project.Engineering data based on the orbiter platform has also yielded significant results.In September to October 2021, Tianwen-1 paused for a while as the sun blocked communications with Earth.

This study is not only beneficial to the genetic improvement of modern maize grain protein content, but also has important guiding significance for reducing the application of fertilizer and protecting the ecological environment in the future.Wu Yongrui’s research team from the Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Wang Wenqin’s research team from Shanghai Normal University jointly published a research paper entitled “THP9 enhances seed protein content and nitrogen-use efficiency in maize” on Nature on Thursday, marking that Teosinte High Protein 9 (THP9), a key variant gene controlling high protein quality formation and efficient nitrogen use in maize, was cloned successfully from wild maize.Since the domestication of maize by the human being as early as 9,000 years ago, maize has become one of the most productive crops in the world, with a global annual output of 1.2 billion tons, including 270 million tons in China, according to media reports.More than 70 percent of maize is used for feed, which is also the most commonly used and the largest type of feed. However, the grain protein content of most hybrids is less than 8 percent due to the low grain protein content of the common maize, so it is often necessary to supplement soybean protein in feed.However, China relies heavily on imports of soybeans, which has become a ""bottleneck"" problem in the country’s livestock and poultry industry. An increase of 1 percentage point in the regular maize protein content indicates that China can import nearly 8 million tons less soybeans.In this regard, increasing the content of maize protein is not only a strategic requirement to ensure national food security, but also one of the important ways to ensure the healthy development of the livestock and poultry industry and feed manufacturing industry.The mechanism of high protein formation in wild maize has been an unsolved problem for a long time, due to the reason that the key genes for controlling total protein content and efficient nitrogen use in maize has not been found.The two research teams began in 2012 to search for high-protein maize donor materials, protein content determination, genetic analysis and population construction, and reached an important experimental conclusion that wild maize contains key genes controlling high protein content.The teams continuously created more than 10 generations of genetic material, extracted more than 40,000 samples of DNA for genotype identification, and determined the protein content of more than 20,000 samples for phenotype analysis, and finally cloned the first major gene THP9 controlling high protein content in maize.In addition, the research teams carried out a large-scale field experiment in Sanya, South China’s Hainan Province, to introduce the wild maize high protein gene ThP9-T hybrid into the maize production cultivar Zheng Dan 958, which has the largest planting area in the country. It can significantly increase the protein content of the hybrid seed, which indicates that the gene has important application potential in the cultivation of high-protein maize.At present, the research results are transforming from the laboratory to the wider field of application, through cooperation with a breeding company in East China’s Anhui Province, which may actually go to the market, according to the insiders.Global Times                          "

He pledged to put into action the important instructions from Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, on promoting peaceful development of cross-Straits relations and facilitating exchanges and cooperation.Noting that the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have a strong desire for normal exchanges, Wang said priority should be given to resume normal cross-Straits exchanges at an early date.""We welcome and support more Taiwan compatriots to participate in the cause of Chinese modernization and national rejuvenation, to share the fruits of development on the mainland and the glory of national rejuvenation,"" Wang said.He stressed that the two parties should further consolidate their common political foundations - upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" deepen political mutual trust, maintain positive interactions, firmly oppose separatist activities aimed at ""Taiwan independence"" and external interference in Taiwan affairs, and jointly safeguard peace and stability across the Straits.Hsia expressed his hope that, on the basis of upholding the 1992 Consensus and opposing ""Taiwan independence,"" the two parties would enhance mutual trust and communication, strengthen exchanges and cooperation, work together for the well-being of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and safeguard peace and stability across the Straits. Wang Jianmin, a senior expert in cross-Straits affairs at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province, told the Global Times on Friday that Wang's meeting with Hsia shows that the Chinese mainland and CPC leaders attach great importance to the KMT delegation's visit.Before the KMT delegation departed, the meeting with Wang Huning had not been on the KMT's confirmed itinerary that was made public, but neither had they denied the meeting would take place. Cross-Straits observers believe that the most important basis for the meeting was the KMT's clear statement of its political stance of opposing ""Taiwan independence.""Only the KMT is capable of promoting cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation, as the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities are firmly opposed to the 1992 Consensus, resulting in the halting of communication channels, Wang Jianmin said.Hsia, the former head of Taiwan island's ""mainland affairs council,"" said before his mainland tour that the trip is focused on the interests of Taiwan compatriots, given the current difficulties in cross-Straits exchanges and the problems that Taiwan businessmen, farmers and fishermen have encountered in exporting agricultural products to the mainland.Hsia certainly did not want to go back empty-handed. If the concerns of cross-Straits trade and business from the island can be properly addressed, it will be of great significance for the KMT in gaining public support on the island, Wang Jianmin said.The visit to the mainland will also make some skeptics of the 1992 Consensus, both within the KMT and on the island, realize its importance and the significance of cross-Straits relations, the expert noted.The KMT should realize that upholding the 1992 Consensus is their most powerful weapon against the DPP and they should never throw that away, he said.

The public was intrigued and discussion became heated partly because the appeals were made after China's population recorded a decrease in 2022, the first decline in six decades.According to Yunnan's sperm bank, donors should be aged between 20 and 40, taller than 1.65 meters, have no infectious or genetic diseases, and should hold or be pursuing a degree.The donor needs to go through a health check and those who qualify will make 8-12 donations, with a subsidy payment of 4,500 yuan ($664).A staff member told the media that usually no more than 20 percent of volunteers are qualified to donate.The Shaanxi sperm bank raised the height criteria to 1.68 meters and the subsidy for a complete donation is 5,000 yuan.The news triggered public interest and people started to compare criteria of different sperm banks.They found Shanghai provides the highest subsidy of 7,000 yuan, while Beijing has the most detailed requirements for a donor's health - baldness, bad living habits such as smoking and drinking, severe nearsightedness and hypertension are on the blacklist.Some interpreted the news as a signal that China will come up with more policies encouraging childbirth amid the country's population decrease. But the latest appeal was more of a result of college students returning to campus after the relaxation of COVID restrictions.Due to the sealing-off of college campuses in the past three years, the donation amount has dropped a lot while patients in need of sperm samples has remained at the normal level, said the staff member from the Yunnan sperm bank.Global Times                         "

If the domestic rescue teams depart now, they will arrive potentially too late,"" Yang said. In order not to increase the burden of the disaster-stricken countries and avoid risks and hidden dangers, the committee called on domestic rescue teams not to leave for the disaster-hit areas in light of the current overall situation. The committee also called on domestic units and rescue teams in the quake-stricken areas to be subject to the dispatch and arrangement of Chinese diplomatic missions abroad, the national rescue teams, relevant government departments of the affected countries and relevant UN agencies. According to the proposal, the rescue efforts have also been fully transferred into disaster relief and resettlement as the survival chances for those still buried dwindled rapidly due to environmental factors such as low temperatures. According to Yang, if local rescue forces want to offer more support to disaster-stricken areas, they can take actions in terms of materials and resettlement. At present, many victims affected by the disaster need temporary accommodation and post-disaster reconstruction work needs to be carried out in an orderly manner. ""The resources available locally may not be able to cope with the serious disaster at present. Since China has accumulated a lot of experiences in coping with natural disasters over recent years, local rescue forces can assist in materials and resettlement,"" Yang said. The Chinese government announced last Tuesday and Wednesday an intention to  and 30 million yuan in emergency humanitarian aid to Syria, with all sectors of Chinese society also extending a helping hand to Turkey and Syria. According to the China International Development Cooperation Agency, the first shipment of 40,000 blankets sent by the Chinese government to Turkey for earthquake relief were delivered from Shanghai Pudong International Airport on Saturday morning, in addition to 1,000 cotton tents.

These cities are also resuming trade with neighboring countries, greeting an influx of tourists, eyeing foreign goods entering their markets and they are excited to resume their traditional winter sports, all without the fear of the coronavirus.GT staff reporters visited a number of border cities, including Heihe and Manzhouli, which connects China and Russia; Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; and witnessed the increased activity after borders were fully reopened. Such quick return of normalcy can also be seen as a mirror of China's rapid bounce back from the COVID-19 shadow. The resilience of its economy, the speed of recovery and the vast market will help the nation to achieve robust growth in the months and years to come. The fully loaded flight from Harbin, capital of Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, already illustrated the revival of Heihe, a border city between China and Russia with a population of about 1.3 million. Heihe is about 571 kilometers from Harbin.New construction trucks parked along both sides of the roads in the city for about three kilometers further demonstrated the fact that the border city Heihe, an important channel for imports and exports as well as a gateway through which Chinese and Russian tourists go to each other's countries, is stepping out of the shadow of the COVID-19 epidemic and returning to old busy days. The Heihe highway port officially resumed two-way customs clearances for goods exchanges on Friday. As of 2 pm that day, the port had conducted clearances for more than 100 vehicles and 1,800 tons of goods, . A bus carrying 19 Russian drivers arrived at the arrival hall of the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge on Friday morning. The drivers excitedly waved their hands to the Global Times reporters and greeted the staff at the inspection station at the port when handling procedures at the arrival hall. Trucks loaded with goods such as soybean oil from Russia continually passed through the guard points of the Heihe port via the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge and parked in front of the arrival hall while waiting to go through the procedures. I am so excited that the toughest days of the epidemic have finally passed and we can meet foreign arrivals face to face again, Wu Chundong, a deputy captain on duty at the Heihe highway port inspection station, told the Global Times. Wu said he can still remember the days when staff at the inspection station had to wear protective clothing and goggles all the year round during work in the past several years. ""The protective clothing is hot and stuffy in summer but cold in winter. And we could only watch the foreign drivers faraway through the goggles as we conducted non-contact procedure during the epidemic.""It is the persistence of all our staff that has guaranteed the function of the Heihe port and earned today's success, Wu said emotionally. Chinese border cities heavily impacted due to the country's COVID-19 control measures as borders were closed for the past three years to keep the coronavirus at bay. From January 8, 2023, China adjusted and optimized its control and prevention measures. On the same day, customs clearance at multiple ports officially resumed, and cross-border tourism, which had been suspended, has been reopened. This has injected much-needed vitality into the border cities. Du Xiaorui, , told the Global Times that the downgrade of management of COVID-19 has smoothened the import and export of goods. Also on January 8, China scraped nucleic acid test for imported goods. ""During the epidemic period, it took us one hour to check one container, sometimes two hours. After the COVID-19 test requirements were scrapped, now it took us only around 10 minutes to check the containers,"" said Du, an inspector at the Manzhouli port in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Dozens of tourists lined up to pose pictures in front of an iced sculpture within a scenic spot at Sayram Lake, the largest and highest alpine lake in Bortala Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture, Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region . ""I traveled here with my mom. This is my first long-haul trip in the past three years. Besides the Sayram Lake, I also went to Altay for skiing,"" said Chen Yizi, a high school student from Shanghai. Though the tourism market in Xinjiang is still at its off season, about two or three thousand tourists visited the Sayram Lake every day, most of whom came by self-driving. Sayram Lake, dubbed the ""last tear of the Atlantic,"" is a must-to-go place for self-driving tours in Xinjiang.Back during the Spring Festival holidays from January 22 to last week, the first such holidays after the country downgraded COVID-19 management, the daily visitors to the lake surpassed 30,000, even more than during the Spring Festival holidays prior to the epidemic, Jiang Hua, deputy director of the management committee of Sayram Lake, told the Global Times.Hotel rooms for tourists at the lake will be increased to 5,000 this year. Other than that, hotels in nearby cities would be fully booked in high season, the Global Times learned. Zhang Rui, an ice hockey coach in Manzhouli, where such winter sports are popular, told the Global Times that he is happy that the hockey training is resumed this winter. ""The COVID-19 outbreak always struck Manzhouli in winter, which is the high season for us to train, as there is snow. Sometimes the kids recorded video of them playing ice hockey and upload on chat app so I can correct their movement,"" said Zhang.""Now that the COVID-19 controls are scrapped, I will increase the kids' training in the near future, so they can improve fast, and carry out Manzhouli's old tradition,"" Zhang laughed.                          "

""Those anti-drug police who sacrificed their lives could have died in vain if celebrities like Han are allowed to come back for money and reputation,"" said one netizen.China's entertainment industry regulations forbid misbehaving stars from appearing on TV and movie screens. In 2014, China's National Radio and Television Administration said celebrities who have used drugs, visited prostitutes or been involved in other law-breaking behaviors should not be invited to appear in programs, movies and TV dramas with lots of their participation should be suspended. In 2021, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China emphasized the punishment for actors who have engaged in illegal or unethical behaviors, banning them from reemerging in public viewAt the same time, China's Anti-Drug Law requires no discrimination for persons subjected to drug rehabilitation when they go to school, get employed or receive social welfare.Experts said the entertainment industry's ban on tainted celebrities doesn't contradict the law's provision of no employment discrimination for these people.The industry regulations block the access of celebrities with drug-taking histories from appearing at the front stage in show business, but they can still find jobs in other industries as they can return to society as ordinary people after detoxification, Wang Sixin, a law professor from the Communication University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday.Wang said that show business should have strict requirements as it is a very special cultural industry, which can easily affect the social climate and trigger the public's imitation, especially that of teenagers.""How about those narcotic police who risk their lives fighting against the drug-related crimes and their families?

Officials from the China Manned Space Agency have said they have received interest in international astronauts flying to Tiangong space station. ESA's decision was the result of Europe being increasingly kidnapped by the US amid the ongoing and prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict, Song Zhongping, a space watcher and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday. Giving up cooperation with China in the manned space domain is clearly short-sighted, which reveals that the US-led camp confrontation has led to a new space race.Wei Dongxu, another space observer, told the Global Times that the US-led sanctions and blockade against Russia's technology have directly impacted the Europe's development of its own space capabilities. For example, the embargo on Russian engines has made it completely impossible for Europe to develop and manufacture its own launchers.The US is applying a zero-sum game and increasing pressure to further rein in Europe and prevent Europe from cooperating with its imaginary competitors and members of the enemy camp, Wei said.China will unwaveringly uphold openness and inclusiveness with its China Space Station, and leave the friendly door open so that when Europe can understand that space-related cooperation with China, unlike that with the US, has no political attachment, Song said.

The expert also noted that the faster peak in population growth and a rapidly aging population will not affect the potential of the country's economic development.According to a latest survey released at the forum, China is currently experiencing a double transition of population and family, with a low fertility rate and an obvious trend of smaller family sizes.The survey was released by the third China Population and Development Forum, hosted by the China Family Planning Association, Committee of Population, Resources and Environment of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee and China Population and Development Research Center, in Beijing on Saturday.According to the survey, the average household size dropped to 2.62 people in 2020, 0.48 fewer than that in 2010. The number of children a woman has now dropped from 1.63 in 2019 to 1.19 in 2022. Delayed marriage and childbearing, non-marriage infertility caused by the changes of family concept have become the most important factors behind declining fertility levels in China.The average age of first marriage for women rose from 22 in the 1980s to 26.3 in 2020, and the age of first childbearing has been pushed back to 27.2. The fertility intention of couple of childbearing age continues to decline. The average number of children they intend to have in 2021 is 1.64, down from 1.76 in 2017 and 1.73 in 2019, while the number of ""post-1990s"" and ""post-2000s,"" as the main fertility subjects, is only 1.54 and 1.48.Lifetime childlessness among women is rising rapidly, from 6.1 percent in 2015 to nearly 10 percent in 2020.Wang Pei'an, Party Secretary and executive vice president of China Family Planning Association, suggested at the forum giving full play to the leading role of the new marriage and childbearing culture, advocating age-appropriate marriage and childbearing, and encouraging couples to share child-rearing responsibilities. He also suggested implementing an annual leave system, gradually adjusting and shortening working hours, introducing flexible working hours, and providing more support for family life and leisure travel. ""We should vigorously develop the homemaking, aged care, and childcare industries, and continue to empower and enhance the efficiency of family construction, so as to raise the level of services for childbirth and continue to improve the quality of the newborn population,"" Wang said.He also noted that, the family should be regarded as the basic unit of public policy, and the orientation of protecting marriage and family and encouraging family members to reunite should be fully reflected in the policies in such fields as urbanization, household registration reform, employment, medical care, pension, social security, housing and taxation.In response to some pessimistic claims over the low birth rate as well as the aging of the population, Li Daokui, Mansfield Freeman Chair Professor of the Department of Finance of the School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University, believes that there are a series of misunderstandings and misinterpretations in the economic circle and even broader society. Such views as ""aging affects aggregate economic demand,"" ""working-age population keeps decreasing"" and ""aging affects social innovation vitality"" do not stand up to scrutiny, Li noted.These misunderstandings arise because the society does not carefully distinguish between the concepts of total population and human resources. The core factor affecting the economic development of a country or a region is not the total population or the total number of young people, but the total number of active, healthy and skilled people who are willing to participate in social and economic activities, Li said. The average life expectancy of Chinese society is constantly increasing, and the educational level of the population is constantly improving. The total amount of human resources is the sum of reserves taking into account population quality and future social labor time, the expert added. The total potential of human resources depends specifically on two factors, the level of health and the level of education. Based on these two factors, Li's team measured the development trend of China's total human resources.Studies by Li's team have shown that although the country's total population has reached its peak and the peak of total labor force participation has long passed, China's total human resources will continue to grow before 2040 and will remain stable from 2040 to 2050 thanks to increasingly levels of both health and education. If 2020 is used as the base year and the total human resources are converted into population equivalent, compared with 1.4249 billion in 2020, the total human resources in the country will rise to 1.644 billion in 2050, an increase of about 15.4 percent. From 2021 to 2050, the average annual growth rate of the country's total human resources will reach 0.48 percent.The studies estimate that if the country's human resources can be effectively promoted and fully utilized, the average growth potential of China's economy will reach 5.9 percent in 2021-2030, 4.9 percent in 2031-2040, and 4.1 percent in 2041-2050.As China has proposed to basically realize socialist modernization by 2035, and to reach the level of moderately developed countries in terms of per capita income. Like reaching the level of Portugal, in fact, a growth rate of 4.61 percent is sufficient.So, how to unleash the total potential of human resources? Li raised three strategies.First, we should adjust social security, design a fair and reasonable pension replacement rate and payment rules, and form positive incentives.Second, the key to education reform is not only to increase the number of years of compulsory education, but more importantly, lifelong learning.Third, we need to improve the health of the whole people, especially the middle-aged and elderly people. We need to help them continue to be active in various social and economic fields.""As long as we get the reforms in place, there is no need to worry about the negative impact of a declining population. Don't focus on the fertility rate, which is hard to change. If we can cope with it properly, Chinese modernization can overcome these two difficulties through a series of reforms. The key is to improve and make good use of human resources, and to become a power in human resources, which is my core point of view,"" Li said.Global Times                         "

In response, earthquake experts explained that this conclusion is not particularly significant from a probabilistic statistical point of view, and there is no need for public panic. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/247cb3d5-e933-4911-9fda-85faad5905ac.jpeg," In the wake of the massive earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, a paper previously written by Chinese earthquake researchers sparked concern among Chinese netizens, which claimed that a strong earthquake in the Eurasian seismic zone could lead to a similarly strong earthquake impacting the Chinese mainland within three years. In response, earthquake experts explained that this conclusion is not particularly significant from a probabilistic statistical point of view, and there is no need for public panic. In addition, the China Earthquake Network Center has concluded after research that the earthquake has no direct impact on the occurrence of strong earthquakes in the Chinese mainland in the short term.The paper, which attracted heated discussion, named ""On the Relationship between Seismic Enhancement of the Eurasian Seismic Belt and the Occurrences of M≥7 Earthquakes in [the Chinese Mainland]"" was published on Chinese journal Earthquake in 2014. The results show that when the ratio of the annually seismic energy released by the M≥7 earthquakes in the Eurasian Seismic Belt, where Turkey and Syria are located in, to that released by the M≥7 earthquakes in the whole world is about 50 percent, and an M≥8 earthquake occurs in the Eurasian Seismic Belt, there would be more than one M≥7 or M8 earthquakes occurring in the Chinese mainland in the following three years. Although the conditions for that conclusion are expected to be met after the major earthquakes took place Turkey and Syria, the public does not need to panic. This is because the prediction is not particularly relevant for future earthquakes in light of past data, seismologists told the Global Times.In the past 100 years, the average probability of an M≥7 earthquake in China is two times in three years, explained Sun Shiyi, a researcher at the CENC, to the Global Times. ""This means that the probability of an M≥7 earthquake occurring in China within three years is relatively high, judging from any point in time,"" he said.The paper is an academic study for scientific specialists. Comparing past and future data is a statistical concept, and there is no need for the public to pay deliberate attention and panic, another geophysical research scholar who requested anonymity told Global Times.In addition, the CENC believes that this major earthquake in Syria, Turkey, will have no direct impact on the occurrence of stronger earthquakes throughout the Chinese mainland in the short term.China is in the eastern part of the Eurasian seismic zone and Turkey is in the western part, and the distance in between is very far. The CNEC experts have counted the relationship between earthquakes near Turkey and M≥6 earthquakes in the Chinese mainland over the past 100 years and found no direct correlation between the two within three months, said Liu Jie, a researcher at the CENC, China Central Television (CCTV) reported.Another fact that may put the public's mind more at ease is that the actual situation in recent years shows a relatively low level of global seismic activity since 2020.According to statistics released by the Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management, since 1900, there have been an average of 133 M≥6 earthquakes, 20 M≥7 earthquakes and one M≥8 earthquake per year worldwide.And from 2020 to 2022, a total of 316 M≥6 earthquakes, 36 M≥7 earthquakes and one M≥8 earthquake have occurred globally, averaging 105, 12 and 0.33 each per year, which is significantly lower than the historical average.In addition, experts explained that the occurrence of earthquakes with high magnitude does not necessarily mean that high casualty events will occur.Earthquakes that cause harm are very complex issues that can only be judged based on a combination of factors such as when they occur and their specific location, Sun said. ""Historically, there have been earthquakes of very high magnitude but no casualties, and there have been earthquakes that have caused secondary disasters resulting in tragic casualties. One of the reasons for the high hazard of this earthquake in Turkey is that it involved several large and medium-sized cities, all of which are densely populated areas,"" he said.Two powerful earthquakes jolted Turkey and Syria on February 6 and more than 1,900 aftershocks followed, causing thousands of buildings to collapse, killing more than 36,000 people as of Monday and leaving millions homeless. Rescuers are still pulling unlikely survivors from the ruins.After the major earthquakes in Turkey and Syria, China recorded a 4.3-magnitude earthquake in Heyuan, South China's Guangdong Province on Saturday and a 2.8-magnitude earthquake in Beijing on Sunday, both of which did not cause casualties.Experts and government departments explained that the level of construction in these areas is fully protected against such low-level earthquakes.

More than 80 people from Russia holding valid visas entered China via this port on Friday.Sasha Savalyka, who works for a large tourism company in Vladivostok, Russia, told the Global Times that while staying in Hunchun, she talked with her business partners about resuming cross-border tourism.She said that she was very excited to return to Hunchun after three years. ""I enjoy the good environment, beautiful scenery and delicious food here. It is very popular among Russian tourists,"" she said.Travel with valid visas resumed at Hunchun port as early as January 8, the day China downgraded its COVID-19 management from Class A to Class B, Li Gang, a deputy director at the management and service center of the entry and exit station of the Hunchun port, told the Global Times on Monday.Land transportation via Hunchun port is also picking up. Outside the hall, new trucks built by China FAW Group, which is based in Jilin, waited in line to enter Russia, along with refrigerated trucks that had just been unloaded.On Monday morning, a 45-car freight train loaded with coal arrived at the Hunchun railway port.Li said that the port maintained freight shipments during the three years of the COVID-19 epidemic while applying non-contact inspections to prevent outbreaks.It has been conducting 24/7 operation since September last year. In 2022 alone, 2.7 million tons of coal arrived at the port, according to Li.Hunchun, administered by the Yanbian Korean autonomous prefecture, has four ports, two to Russia and two to North Korea. With Hunchun serving as a distribution center, international logistics operators can realize sea-railway-land combined transport. Goods from Russia, Japan, South Korea and even South America could reach the nearby port and be transported into China, and vice versa, the Global Times learned.Thanks to its unique location, Hunchun has become a distribution center for seafood imports and exports. During the epidemic, business in this area operated in an orderly manner, and business owners look forward to further development after the epidemic.Zhao Kuizheng, manager of the Hunchun X.Y. Seafood Co, told the Global Times that the Hunchun government offered strong support during the epidemic to ensure continuous transportation and imports of frozen seafood while ensuring efficient implementation of the strict policies. China applied strict inspection and disinfection policies for imported cold-chain seafood.""We required our Russian partner to apply the same strict disinfection policies as ours, including negative nucleic acid testing results of all related personnel, disinfection reports for all imported products and closed-loop management in sourcing the products,"" Zhao said.Zhao said that he is confident about business due to the adjustment of China's COVID-19 policies and the gradual resumption of cross-border exchanges in Hunchun.

To avoid cheating, some Chinese social sciences journals have released instructions on using artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools, requesting authors who use such tools to acknowledge and explain the usage, or their papers will be rejected or withdrawn.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/96c093f8-81de-42e8-8be4-74d4d8252fc9.png,"  Following the frenzied interest in ChatGPT, OpenAI's highly regarded chatbot, concerns over academic misconduct by using such AI-enabled tools have arisen. To avoid cheating, some Chinese social sciences journals have released instructions on using artificial intelligence (AI) writing tools, requesting authors who use such tools to acknowledge and explain the usage, or their papers will be rejected or withdrawn.Instead of simply banning the tools, using them in a rational and scientific way can free scholars, teachers and students from repetitive and thoughtless work and learning so that they can be more devoted to complex learning and creativity, some education insiders believe.On Friday, the Jinan Journal, included in the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI), announced that any large language modeling tools (e.g. ChatGPT) will not be accepted individually or co-signed. If relevant tools have been used in the composition of the paper, the author should propose the usage separately in the paper, explain in detail how they used them and demonstrate the author's own creativity in the paper. If there is any hidden use of the tools, the article will be directly rejected or withdrawn, read the announcement.Also, Journal of Tianjin Normal University (Elementary Education Edition) on Saturday published an announcement, advocating the rational use of new tools and technologies, and suggesting authors to explain the use of AI writing tools (such as ChatGPT) in references, acknowledgments and other texts.The journal noted that they will strengthen the review of academic papers, resolutely resist academic misconduct, and seek scientific, accurate, complete and innovative basic education research.To battle the plagiarism, some schools in the US have responded to ChatGPT by cracking down, according to the News York Times. New York City public schools, for example, recently blocked ChatGPT access on school computers and networks, citing “concerns about negative impacts on student learning, and concerns regarding the safety and accuracy of content.” Schools in other cities, including Seattle, have also restricted access.A US’ online course provider Study.com recently asked 1,000 students over the age of 18 about the use of ChatGPT in the classroom. The responses were surprising. Around 89 percent said they'd used it on homework. Some 48 percent confessed they'd already made use of it to complete an at-home test or quiz. Over 50 percent said they used ChatGPT to write an essay, while 22 percent admitted to having asked ChatGPT for a paper outline.While the chatbot is raising fears of academic cheating on school campuses, some education insiders believe introducing the AI-ended tools to the academics could even overturn the traditional education.For researchers, finding valuable scientific problems and solving them in creative ways come first, and then writing academic papers. Some AI-enabled writing tools can create and polish words or even write long text based on a few keywords shortly, Zhu Wei, a profess or from the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Monday.For example, ChatGPT helps writers gather reference materials for their papers, which not only increases the efficiency of the work, but also allows researchers to devote more energy to more creative work.Whether to use ChatGPT depends on whether there is cognitive investment in using it. For those students who just use it to cope with homework or exams, Zhu said this is putting the cart before the horse, which should be restricted.To avoid academic misconducts through using the tools, Zhu suggested introducing software to help educators sift through text generated by ChatGPT.Zhu believes schools should embrace ChatGPT as a teaching aid which could unlock creativity in students.The core role of such tools is not to replace human thinking, but to enhance human thinking, Zhu said.

Although normal campus life was upended by COVID-19 controls in the past three years, students learned to cherish the opportunity of studying and the future ahead. Li Lei, whose child studies at a Beijing primary school, said that there are no requirements for students to return to school. ""The teacher told us to report any discomfort among our children. In such cases, students can rest at home.""A father of a first-grader in Beijing surnamed Hu told the Global Times that his daughter has not been infected with novel coronavirus yet. ""We take a fast antigen test every day at home,"" Hu said. Although he's a little concerned about a cluster infection at school, he is happy to send his daughter back to campus. ""It is better to let her live a normal life. She has friends at school, and we worry that staying at home all the time will affect her ability to socialize,"" the father said. Yang Jian (pseudonym), a senior high school student in Beijing, got up at 5 am to prepare for a return to campus. ""I have only half a year left in my senior year, so I am happy that things are back to normal,"" said Yang. He will focus on preparing for the gaokao, the national college entrance examinations, and cherish the rest of his time with his classmates.Most Chinese schools, including universities, kicked off the new semester around mid-February. Although the country has scrapped most of its COVID-19 controls, schools are still taking measures in preparation to welcome 300 million students' return to campus.A student surnamed Huang at Zhejiang University told the Global Times that her tutor asked the students to fill in a health form that includes antigen test results for COVID-19, a week before class started. New health stations were set up on campus, which provide separate rooms for anyone who is infected and provide relevant services.  Last week, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan visited campuses in Beijing, including world-renowned Peking University and Tsinghua University. She urged schools at all levels to implement and optimize COVID-19 prevention management and fully restore the normal operation of teaching activities.Last week, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), said that China has just gone through a nationwide outbreak, from which most people have recovered or are still recovering. ""The overall immunity of the population is at a relatively high level,"" said Wu, noting that it is unlikely that a new wave of mass infections will occur in the coming months. Beijing's CDC announced on Monday that the situation in the capital was stable, with 4.69 percent of those who took nucleic acid tests getting a positive result. Many schools are bringing psychological health into classes to help students return to campus with a positive attitude and adjust their mindset from long-term online schooling. Many schools also set up offices for psychological consultation.The time when spring semester begins is a high time for psychological crises among primary and middle school students, news portal thepaper.cn reported, citing education officials from Ruian, a city in Zhejiang. It said that this year, the crisis will be more severe due to the change in COVID-19 policies and a prolonged winter vacation. To ease students' pressure, the Ruian education authority asked schools not to force students to report with homework.Song Meihua, an official at a primary school in Manzhouli in North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said the return of normal campus life will offer a positive and healthy atmosphere for students whose campus life was disrupted by COVID-19 control measures.""Our students and teachers are harboring hopes for the new semester, when all of us can sit in the classroom for study and hang out together,"" said Song. She believed that a return to campus life is meaningful for students from every perspective. Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University, said that online study had an impact on students. ""Yet it was a must choice, in the face of an unknown and lethal virus,"" said Zhang, who is confident that students will soon adapt to the new normal in post-pandemic era.  A survey by recruitment website 51job.com published in November revealed that more than half of employers were not concerned about online studies' impact on students; instead they valued personal ability more.Huang from Zhejiang University, who has only one and a half years left on campus, said COVID-19 disrupted her university life in the past year, as she missed late-night talks with roommates, puppy love and even the food in the university canteen. ""But it taught me a valuable lesson. Now with the new semester kicking off, the new post-COVID life unfolds in front of me.""                         "

Covering an area of 401 square kilometers, Angkor contains the magnificent remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire from the ninth to the 15th century, and it consists of scores of key temples such as Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom, Bayon, Chau Say Tevoda and Ta Keo, among others.China has sent expert teams to help restore ruined temples there since 1997, working on the Chau Say Tevoda temple and the Ta Keo temple successfully. The experts were hailed as Chinese defenders guarding precious Asian cultural heritage.In the joint statement on building a China-Cambodia community with a shared future in the new era released on February 11, both sides agreed to promote the China-aid Project of Royal Palace Restoration in Angkor and protection and restoration of Preah Vihear Temple and other cultural heritage sites. The two sides are committed to joint action to preserve Asian cultural heritage, and are exploring the establishment of a China-Cambodia joint working group on cultural heritage, to promote across-the-spectrum cooperation.At the forum, young students from China and Cambodia were also honored for spreading friendship between the two countries through short videos, demonstrating the practice of building a community with a shared future by the next generation of the two countries.In the field of education, Huaneng Group has sponsored a Chinese culture study campaign at the Royal University of Phnom Penh in Cambodia, funding five local teachers and five students in exploring China's classical culture.In his address, Cambodian Ambassador to China Khek Cai Mealy Sysoda pointed out the traditional friendship between the two countries dates back to ancient times and will go up to a higher level, with reinforced co-efforts in economy, trade and culture.Investment and flagship projects China promotes in Cambodia have transferred advanced experience in hydropower construction and helped cultivate talent for Cambodia and other Lancang-Mekong countries.One example is the Lower Sesan 2 Hydro Power dam, which was built and managed by China Huaneng Group. The dam is Cambodia's largest hydropower station and accounts for about one-fifth of the country's annual power generation, meeting the electricity needs of about 2.6 million people every year.Wang Hailong, who is in charge of public relations for the project, told the Global Times on Thursday that since the station was put into operation in 2008, China Huaneng has trained more than 200 local technicians and managers. The company also created more than 2,000 jobs for local people at the peak of construction.The project led to the relocation of 840 households and 3,690 poor people in the surrounding area, helping them move to villages with better living conditions, he said.The project is a model in energy cooperation between countries, providing stable clean energy for Cambodia's national grid and reversing the country's heavy dependence on imported electricity. The enterprise also set up free electricity industry training centers and has offered scholarships to relocated migrants.Deng Jianlin, the general manager of Huaneng Group, vowed at the forum to further implement the provisions in the China-Cambodia joint statement for strengthening hydropower, photovoltaic and other clean energy cooperation, and exploring green, stable and reliable energy.Stung Treng Governor Svay Sam Eang praised the social responsibility endeavors of Chinese enterprises in the region.A white paper on China's corporate image in Cambodia, compiled by the Royal Academy of Cambodia, Cambodia's top scientific research institution, assisted by Beijing Foreign Studies Universities, was launched at the forum. The paper shows the activities of Chinese enterprises in Cambodia, from innovative practices to open-minded sharing.The white paper underlines a positive image of Chinese enterprises in Cambodia, featuring honest management, innovation, openness, and responsibility, along with concrete actions to build a community with a shared future.

The move has sparked heated discussion among Chinese netizens.The bride price is a traditional Chinese prerequisite for marriage. Giving a bride price as a betrothal gift has a long history in China as a goodwill gesture between the couple and their two families. However, the bride price has risen from a token amount to very high levels, particularly in poorer areas, and the nature of the traditional customs has changed a lot over the years, becoming a financial burden for many families.Dingxi in Northwest China's Gansu Province has released details of its achievements after the implementation of a campaign in June 2022 to curb excessive bride prices. The city is one of the last areas in China to be lifted out of poverty at the end of 2020.According to the Chinese media outlet The Paper, since the campaign, 70 percent of married couples in Dingxi have received less than 50,000 yuan ($7325) as the bride price, down 10.9 percent from before the campaign.The local campaign also stipulates that wedding parties should have no more than 20 tables both in urban areas and rural areas, with each table costing no more than 880 yuan ($129) in urban areas and 480 yuan ($70) in rural areas.Multiple cities in East China's Jiangxi Province, which have long been known for exorbitant bride prices, are also stepping up their campaigns to address the custom.For example, Leping city held a meeting to deploy a three-year special action to promote the transformation of local outdated customs and tradition on February 6.The city previously found itself in the spotlight after a rumor that a local bride asked for 880,000 yuan ($128,977) for the marriage earlier this month.The rumor was identified by the police as having been fabricated, but it was still a blow to the city's image and that of the province.Lin Weichun, the city's Party secretary, said at a meeting on February 6 that high bride prices and other outdated customs still exist in some local areas, endangering family harmony and stability, seriously affecting the city's reputation, and causing a negative impact on the investment environment. It is necessary to face up to these problems, take special actions and work hard to curb them, Lin said.Separately, as early as 2017, performance in the work of changing outdated customs was included in the assessment of village officials in Guangchang county in Jiangxi, and in 2022 it was included in the training program for local officials.On September 28, 2022, Guangchang held a group wedding for 10 couples with ""zero bride price,"" vigorously promoting newlywed fashion. The online livestreaming of the group wedding was watched by more than 40,000 people.Last September, eight national departments, including China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, jointly issued a notice to address the problems of excessive bride prices and extravagant wedding ceremonies in China's rural areas, rolling out a special work plan for a nationwide campaign.An official from Shangrao, another city in Jiangxi, who requested anonymity, told the Global Times on Monday that such exorbitant bride prices never used to be a folk custom or the historical tradition of Jiangxi.A few years ago, with the improvement of people's economic income and living standards, people started to ask for higher bride prices, the official said, adding that binding the lifelong happiness of young men and women to material conditions went against traditional virtues.The official revealed a surprising but typical phenomenon that in some urban areas, the bride price is usually in the range of 100,000 to 150,000 yuan, while in some rural areas, the price is even higher. For example, prices of 188,000 and 288,000 yuan are common in less-economically developed areas.The official said that it is unrealistic and unnecessary to completely stop or forcibly curb the bride price tradition, but excessive and unaffordable bride prices should be restricted.Now Party members and officials in many areas have taken a leading role in setting an example for villagers by voluntarily rejecting oversized wedding and funeral banquets and other outdated customs, he said.China has a long way to go before society can rid itself of the bride price custom, Zhang Yiwu, a professor at Peking University, told the Global Times.

He was given 40 minutes to share his work but he only talked for 25 minutes, mostly on basic scientific facts. He spent less than two minutes talking about his own work, mainly in general terms.He confirmed that he is currently working in a new gene research on Duchenne muscular dystrophy. He mentioned the plan of setting up an international ethics committee for his current lab, but did not give any specification on its membership, plan or timeline.In 2018, He, a genome-editing researcher at the Southern University of Science and Technology of China in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, shocked the world as he claimed to have created the world's first genetically modified humans.He was sentenced to three years in prison for illegally conducting the human embryo gene-editing intended for reproduction. He was reportedly released from prison in April 2022.He caught most attention at the Saturday event as media and other researchers present kept asking him for details of his past controversial research and ethical issues surrounding the application of gene-editing technology. However, He declined to provide direct answers to these questions and instead emphasized the need for clearer regulations in both the US and China.It is understandable that the public concerned about the past controversial research of He, including the current status of the gene-edited babies born during the research, but what is more important is that we should look back to and learn from the case to prevent similar problems in the future, Lei Ruipeng at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan and Joy Zhang, a collaborator of the event, said at the event. The discussion highlighted regulatory and communicative gaps in China which we hope will receive due attention from relevant authorities, according to a summary of the event that Lei sent to the Global Times.It also became evident that the research restrictions on He and the institutions responsible for enforcing them are not publicly known. Chinese participants have made explicit calls for more regulatory clarity within China, read the summary.Xie Shangxian of Huazhong University of Science and Technology said at the event that regional disparity in ethics assessment and enforcement standards pose a challenge in China.Xie underlined the explorative and future-oriented nature of science, which contrasts with the restrictive and history-based characteristics of bioethics. How to balance these two conflicting forces is the key challenge, Xie said.After the controversial experiment of He in 2018, Chinese authorities and scientists have been enhancing regulations and discussions on bioethics. In October 2020, China set up a national science and technology ethics committee to improve the environment for scientific innovation.Some scientists also suggested  for the three gene-editing babies born in He's experiment, as well as their descendants.

supplies including first-aid kits for earthquake relief left Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu on Tuesday morning and is expected to arrive in Damascus, Syria, on February 15 local time, according to China International Development Cooperation Agency. The supplies include 30,000 first-aid kits, 10,000 sets of cotton clothes, 300 cotton tents, 20,000 blankets and 70,000 adult pull-up diapers, as well as emergency medical equipment and supplies such as ventilators, anesthesia machines, oxygen generators and LED shadowless lamps. In addition to supplies provided by the Red Cross Society of China to Syria that has arrived in Damascus, the second batch of humanitarian aid supplies has arrived in Damascus on Monday local time. The supplies included cotton tents, relief kits for families, thermal outdoor jackets and other living supplies as well as medicines and other medical supplies urgently needed in the disaster area, which can benefit more than 10,000 people affected by the disaster.Nearly a week since the most devastating earthquakes in recent history, rescuers in Turkey and Syria were searching for signs of life in freezing temperatures as the death toll surpassed 33,000. The United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths on Sunday said in a post on Twitter that international help has ""failed the people in northwest Syria,"" where more than 12 years of civil war have resulted in a complex political situation. Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the United Nations, on Monday called for an immediate lifting of unilateral sanctions by the countries concerned to return the ""hope of survival"" to children in countries like Syria. Zhang pointed to the ""harsh reality"" at the UN Security Council Briefing on Children and Armed Conflict, saying that unilateral sanctions are decimating the economic foundations and development capacity of the countries affected, robbing many children of their right to development and right to survival, which are the most fundamental of all rights. In the aftermath of the powerful earthquake in Syria, the unlawful unilateral sanctions have led to a severe shortage of heavy equipment and search and rescue tools, raising grave concerns that many children under the rubble may have perished as a result of untimely rescue or insufficient rescue capacity, Zhang said.""We urge the countries concerned to lift all their unlawful unilateral sanctions immediately without conditions, not to become accomplices to the natural disaster, not to rob Syrian children of their hope of survival, and desist from their hypocritical political grandstanding,"" he said.Zhang said children are the most innocent group and the most vulnerable victims in armed conflict, and stressed that conflict prevention and resolution must be the primary and ultimate means of protection.The envoy highlighted the needs to seek political solutions to resolve conflict, and invest more efforts in negotiation, good offices, and mediation, instead of resorting to sanctions and other coercive measures, much less fanning the flames or adding fuel to the fire, which would only serve some parties' self-interests by prolonging and spreading conflicts. To have that peace, it is imperative to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter in good faith, and that entails respecting other countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity, refraining from interference in their internal affairs, opposing maneuvers aimed at government change, and opposing the practice of creating chaos and exporting unrest in the name of counterterrorism or democracy, Zhang said. To have that peace, it is imperative to uphold true multilateralism, strengthen dialogue and cooperation, work together to build the architecture of common security, and unequivocally reject and oppose unilateralism, the Cold War mentality, bloc politics, and confrontation between ""us and them,"" Zhang added. The rule of law must be the fundamental guidance for prevention, Zhang said, adding that ""supporting children's development must be the overarching direction of our endeavors.""""To effectively prevent violations against children, we must enhance the spirit of rule of law, and put into practice the requirements of international law on the protection of children in armed conflicts,"" he said. ""The UN must coordinate humanitarian and development resources in a way that prioritizes the eradication of poverty, zero hunger, universal education, and physical and mental health in its work to protect children,"" Zhang added. Zhang urged ""the last country in the world"" that has not ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child to act without delay, ""so that this vital Convention can truly achieve universal coverage.""The US is the only country unwilling to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Global Times                         "

""There are no confirmed sequelae of COVID-19, at least not yet evidence of sequelae,"" he added.The epidemiologist said that recovered patients are resistant to the virus and will not be re-infected with the same strain of the virus for a short period of time. However, there is no lifelong immunity after the infection with COVID-19 as far as the relevant cases are concerned. As time goes by and new strains emerge, infection is still possible for those who were infected before, but the chance is smaller.As for whether the symptoms will become more severe after re-infection, Chong said that China has not been through two consecutive large-scale infection situations at present, which means that observable data is so limited to draw exact conclusions.However, it is certain that people infected with coronavirus are basically not infectious after they have recovered from the illness and they are unlikely to spread the virus and are safe for the community, Chong said.Global Times                         "

As a result, clusters of norovirus infection are likely to occur in places where people gather, such as schools and nurseries.People can be infected with the virus through multiple ways -- eating food or drinking water contaminated by the norovirus, exposure to aerosols produced by fecal matter or vomit of patients, or indirect contact with objects or the environment contaminated by vomit or excrement.The virus can survive in the range of 0 C‐60 C, and ordinary hot water cannot kill norovirus. Also, 75% alcohol and hand sanitizer do not inactivate norovirus, the Guangdong CDC stated, noting that the virus can survive for two weeks on surfaces and more than two months in water.According to the Guangdong CDC, the incubation period of norovirus infection is short, usually 12 to 48 hours. The most common symptoms of norovirus infection are vomiting and diarrhea, followed by nausea, abdominal pain, headache, fever, chills and muscle soreness. Vomiting is the main cause in children, and diarrhea is the main cause in adults.The onset of norovirus infection is rapid and self-limited. Most patients can recover within 2 to 3 days after onset. A small number of infants and the elderly, especially those with underlying diseases, may suffer more serious symptoms such as dehydration and slow recovery.East China's Jiangsu and Central China's Henan health authorities also released similar notice. They noted patients with norovirus gastroenteritis should be quarantined at home until two days after the symptoms disappear completely. The best way to prevent norovirus is to frequently wash hands and use disinfectant . Alcohol disinfection is not effective against norovirus and that chlorinated disinfectant is recommended.Guangdong CDC also listed other possible virus infections. It said at present, the COVID-19 epidemic situation in the province is at a low level and stable.In winter and spring, there is still a risk of sporadic human cases of avian influenza such as H5N6 and H9N2, and other less common subtypes of human avian influenza cannot be ruled out.Recently, the proportion of influenza-like cases in Guangdong was lower than the baseline level, and no outbreaks of influenza-like cases and clusters of upper respiratory tract infections were reported.But considering there is usually a peak of influenza in winter and spring in the province, Guangdong CDC said that with the beginning of the new semester in February, they would pay attention to the change in influenza activity level.Global Times                         "

Many netizens, when criticizing the US for not properly handling the disaster, also questioned if the US government is trying to deliberately withhold information, and hype a balloon incident involving China to divert domestic media attention.The incident occurred on February 3, when 50 cars, including 10 carrying hazardous materials, derailed in a fiery crash in East Palestine, according to rail operator Norfolk Southern and the National Transportation Safety Board. Vinyl chloride was slowly released into the air days from five of those cars before crews ignited it to get rid of the highly flammable, toxic chemicals in a controlled environment, creating a dark plume of smoke.First responders and emergency workers had to vent the tankers, spill the vinyl chloride into a trench, and then burn it off before it turned the train into a bomb.Yet officials warned the controlled burn would send phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the air. Phosgene is a highly toxic, colorless gas with a strong odor that can cause vomiting and breathing trouble and was used as a weapon in World War I, according to AP.By the next day, an official alert warned that local residents needed to move even further away from the disaster zone, beyond the previous 2-mile radius. Roughly half of the affected town's 4,800 residents had to evacuate. The controlled burn worked and the evacuation order for East Palestine residents was officially lifted February 8 after real-time air and water monitoring did not find any contaminant levels above screening limits.Two Chinese students who are currently studying in Ohio told the Global Times that they have not heard of any relevant information, nor seen the story reported by mainstream US media outlets, adding that the local government had provided no notice over the incident. ""I've been feeling rhinitis in recent days, which never happened to me before so I am planning to see the doctor soon,"" said a Chinese student surnamed Zan. She said she was only aware of ""such a horrific incident"" via Chinese social media.Another student surnamed Sun, who lives 72 kilometers from the affected area said people are stockpiling mineral water. ""Although the government assured people that the any immediate danger has passed, people still remain dubious.""The US Environmental Protection Agency has not yet responded to the Global Times as of press time. The incident has recently triggered heated discussion on Chinese social media, with some comparing it to ""a Chernobyl-level"" catastrophe. Peng Yingdeng, an expert from China's central government supervision center for environmental protection and emergency management told media that vinyl chloride is highly inflammable, when it burns it released carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid. The latter, when combined with precipitation will produce acid rain and make the land untillable. If the vinyl chloride is not burnt completely, it will release more toxic dioxins and phosgene.Dioxins is very difficult to degrade naturally, and once it permeates into soil, may remain there for decades, Peng said. He noted that the grains produced from this soil will cause cancer and mutation inside human bodies.A large number of Chinese netizens are also questioning why such a catastrophic incident has gained little exposure through the Western media, and whether the US is deliberately withholding information from the world. As of time of press, four of the 50 most searched topics on China's Sina Weibo were related to the Ohio incident. Hashtag ""release of vinyl chloride in Ohio has caused evacuation of residents"" has been read on Weibo for more than 34 million times as of press time.On Twitter, the hashtag #OhioChernobyl was trending, with one user on the platform claiming ""Everything along this pathway will experience one of the world's worst carcinogens on the planet. Areas within a 100-mile radius are reporting mass animal deaths.""""Why on earth is the US withholding details about such a serious accident? If you look at the US media right now, it is all about Chinese balloon stories. I doubt they are deliberately hyping the balloon stories to divert people's attention from the real catastrophe,"" said a Sina Weibo user, calling the US media also playing ""selectively blind.""Chinese netizens also picked up that a US journalist trying to cover the incident was detained by police, saying ""so much for the US style freedom of press. Imagine if such thing happened in China, a big accident, and stifling journalists, how would the Western media not cover this?""US law enforcement officers interrupted NewsNation correspondent Evan Lambert as he broadcast from the disaster zone, where authorities announced they were?lifting a multiday evacuation order near the site of a fiery weekend derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. East Palestine police officers placed Lambert under arrest on preliminary charges of criminal trespassing and resisting arrest, Columbiana County Sheriff Brian McLaughlin told CNN.""No journalist expects to be arrested when you're doing your job, and I think that's really important that that doesn't happen in our country,"" Lambert told his network in an aired interview after his release.

To a certain extent, a ventilator replaces the function of the lungs to help the patient to ventilate, and delivers high concentrations of oxygen and air into the patient's body, helping them to breathe and maintain a normal respiratory rhythm.An industry insider told the Global Times that ventilators can buy valuable time for clinical treatment and virus eradication for the ill.Chinese ventilator makers demonstrated strong production capacity at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020.Xu Kemin, a senior official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, said at a press conference in March 2020 that the country had a total of 21 producers of invasive ventilators, eight of which had a weekly production capacity of about 2,200 units, accounting for 20 percent of global production capacity.Xu noted that a respirator has thousands of parts, and the main suppliers are not only in China but also abroad, including in Europe. Due to the pandemic, it was not easy to ramp up production quickly.Faced with problems in the global industry chain, major domestic ventilator makers started to reorganize supply chains, seek alternative suppliers in the domestic market and improve production technology. For instance, Beijing Aerospace Changfeng said it focused on the localization of its critical care ventilator after 2020, and it completed the layout of the product line after obtaining registration certificates for two other types of ventilators.The company has delivered ventilators to customers in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other county-level hospitals.Recently, some provinces across China including Guangdong, Sichuan and Gansu have announced plans to procure equipment to expand critical care resources, including ventilators.According to the announcement by the National Health Commission that downgraded COVID-19 to Class B management on December 26, 2022, the administration vowed to increase investment in medical resources, focusing on the supply of respiratory therapy devices, ventilators and other critical care equipment.Recently, some provinces across China including Guangdong, Sichuan and Gansu have announced plans to procure equipment to expand critical care resources, including ventilators.According to the announcement by the National Health Commission that downgraded COVID-19 to Class B management on December 26, 2022, the administration vowed to increase investment in medical resources, focusing on the supply of respiratory therapy devices, ventilators and other critical care equipment.

The carrier said the resumption of international flights requires a preparation process, and it is intensively gearing up efforts. China Southern Airlines said the total number of weekly scheduled flights for outbound routes will reach 373 during the Spring Festival travel rush, which will last for 40 days till February 6.Other airlines made similar decisions, such as Spring Airlines, which said that it will resume daily services from Shanghai to Phuket from January 18. The route from Guangzhou to Chiang Mai will resume from January 18. Juneyao Air said that starting from January 18, it will resume international passenger flights from Shanghai to Chiang Mai.The border reopening gives a shot in the arm to market confidence, dampened for the past three years. The CAAC said that this year, it aims to return to 75 percent of the 2019 level in terms of flight market performance.Industry analysts said that the recovery of international routes is not moving very quickly,  disturbances, with some countries and regions tightening visa requirements for Chinese tourists.Japan had more stringent PCR test requirements starting from Sunday targeting travelers from China with additional measures requiring negative test results taken within 72 hours of passengers boarding direct flights from China, according to media reports.EU countries agreed on Wednesday to ""strongly encourage"" a proposed requirement that would obligate all travelers from China, regardless of nationality, to present negative COVID-19 tests, Euronews reported on Wednesday.The total number of international flights has been at a low level for a long time during the pandemic, and domestic airlines and airports still need time to adapt. It will also take time for consumers to rebuild confidence, Luo Chengzhao, an analyst from aviation data consultancy CADAS, told the Global Times on Sunday. There will be a recovery of 10-20 percent in the level of international flights in the current flying season, instead of explosive growth, Luo said, but starting from the next season, which begins in March, there will be a fast rebound.                          "
Company,By GT staff reporters  |  2023/1/8 20:38:10,Spring Festival travel rush kicks off with a bang,"With China's Chunyun or Spring Festival travel rush, the largest annual human migration worldwide, just kicking off, it is expected that travel for this holiday, the first after the nation's policy adjustment on the pandemic, will help bolster local economic activity, which has been dampened by the virus for the past three years.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/d4537fd0-2274-4164-8e02-2d2dc43f0039.jpeg,"    With China's  or Spring Festival travel rush, the largest annual human migration worldwide, just kicking off, it is expected that travel for this holiday, the first after the nation's policy adjustment on the pandemic, will help bolster local economic activity, which has been dampened by the virus for the past three years.Although the 2023  is marked by many uncertainties as a surge in infections may occur, people's yearning for homeward-bound travel can no longer be restricted, and consumption linked to passenger flows is expected to be a shot in the arm for the world's second largest economy, experts told the Global Times.A total of 34.736 million passenger trips were made by railways, highways, waterways, and civil aviation across the country on Saturday, up 38.9 percent over the same period in 2022, the official data showed on Sunday.National railways are estimated to have carried 6.3 million passengers, according to China Railway. More than 10,000 domestic flights were scheduled on Saturday, a year-on-year increase of 13 percent, and the daily passenger volume exceeded 1 million, reaching a peak unseen in months, according to data from Umetrip, a popular flight information app in China.The number of passenger trips during this year's Spring Festival travel season is expected to surge 99.5 percent from the same period last year to reach nearly 2.1 billion. Passenger trips by air, rail and road are set to reach 70.3 percent of the pre-pandemic levels in 2019, Xu Chengguang, an official from the Ministry of Transport, told a press conference on Friday.""It is still very good to estimate passenger traffic reaching 70 percent of the level of 2019, because the average passenger traffic in China in the past three years might not have reached half of that in 2019,"" Tian Yun, a veteran economist and former vice director of the Beijing Economic Operation Association, told the Global Times on Sunday.In its latest move, China downgraded the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B starting from Sunday. In early December, the country adjusted its virus prevention and control policies with 10 new measures, shifting the policy focus from infection prevention to prevention of severe cases.Xu said the 2023  will have the most uncertainties, and could be the most complex in recent years.Although many places in China are still experiencing peak outbreaks, and some people are still fighting the virus, ""we have seen people's yearning to return to the pre-pandemic state under the current adjustment of COVID prevention and control policies is very strong,"" Tian said.""With the optimization and adjustment of COVID prevention and control measures and the accelerated cross-regional personnel flows, the passenger flows during the Spring Festival travel season will shift from low-level operation to rapid recovery,"" he added.In the past two years, the majority of Chinese people stayed put amid virus curbs during the festival. They are now swarming into train stations, airports and long-distance bus terminals to travel for family reunions on the Lunar New Year's eve, which falls on January 21 this year.Data from online travel agency Trip.com showed that since January 4, the popularity of Spring Festival travel among passengers on the platform has soared, and the number of railway travel inquiries and reservations recorded new highs for three consecutive days. The person in charge of relevant business at the company said that due to the optimistic travel expectations of passengers and their urgent desire to return home, the travel booking peak in 2023 is about one week earlier than previous years under the impact of the COVID-19 control measures, and booking popularity will continue to grow.Notably, this year's Spring Festival travel rush will see the passenger travel radius reach the highest level in three years.Compared with the average travel radius of 402 kilometers for railway travel and 1,369 kilometers for flights last year, as of 9 am on Saturday, the travel radius of railway for the 2023 Spring Festival travel rush reached 692 kilometers, up 72 percent and that of the air travel orders reached 1,950 kilometers, up 43 percent.""Thanks to the free flow of people, we can see the revival of economic activities: accommodation, catering and sales at scenic spots... where there are visitors, there is hope of economic revival,"" Tian said.More domestic consumption will further drive investments and expand government revenues, which are used to improve local infrastructure and social welfare to better facilitate consumption, forging an upward economic cycle, he said.Tian said that the summer holidays in 2023 will likely see passenger flows reaching the same levels of 2019, and the week-long National Day holidays in early October may witness another travel peak, putting the pandemic further away in the rear mirror.

Company,By Wei Jianguo  |  2023/1/8 23:14:50,Effective coordination in epidemic prevention and economic development empowers China's stronger opening-up ,"At a regular press conference of China's Ministry of Commerce held on Friday, the spokesperson said that many foreign-funded enterprises indicated that they had begun to schedule high-level visits to China - while this will just be the prelude. 
",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-08/5fa5d862-a880-4f8d-924a-c60a10b1f1db.jpeg," At a regular press conference of China's Ministry of Commerce held on Friday, the spokesperson said that many foreign-funded enterprises indicated that they had begun to schedule high-level visits to China - while this will just be the prelude. Over the past three years or so, China has achieved efficient coordination of epidemic control and economic development, which is obvious to foreign-funded enterprises in China. From Sunday, China has entered a new phase of COVID-19 response and started to manage COVID-19 with measures against Class B infectious diseases instead of the more serious Class A, and no longer adopts quarantine infectious disease management measures for entry personnel and products.  This year is also the first year after the successful conclusion of 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Foreign companies in China have already begun to rush ahead, casting a vote of confidence in China. These all sent a strong signal, that is, more than three years after the outbreak of the epidemic, China, as the world's largest market, still maintains a huge attraction for foreign investment.In 2021, global foreign direct investment (FDI) amounted to roughly $1.6 trillion, and China's total FDI reached a record $173.48 billion. I estimate that China's foreign investment in 2022 is expected to exceed $200 billion, and will reach $220 billion to $230 billion this year, which means China is highly likely to surpass the US, becoming the country that attracts the most foreign direct investment in the world. These demonstrated that China has stabilized foreign investment while effectively containing the epidemic. Over the short to medium term, there will be three ""simultaneous developments"" in China's efforts of attracting foreign investment: the simultaneous development of foreign investment in the eastern coastal areas and the central and western regions, and the central and western regions are likely to surpass the coastal areas. Large projects worth tens of billions of dollars and small projects of less than 1 billion dollars, multinational corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises in the US and Europe will be equally important; high-tech projects are carried out simultaneously with manufacturing and labor-intensive projects. These developments have not just emerged as a result of the adjustment and optimization of China epidemic prevention and control measures, but are the concentrated release of relevant advantages and potential over the three-year anti-epidemic process.The Communist Party of China Central Committee, with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, has united and led the whole Party and the Chinese people in pursuing progress while maintaining stability. By focusing on epidemic prevention and control and economic development at the same time, China has achieved major positive results of balancing epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development.First, China's high-level opening-up and stable investment environment have been recognized by foreign businessmen, especially multinational companies. For three years, this megatrend has continued unabated. A high-level open market full of certainty, innovation, fairness and justice is a fertile ground for global investors to realize their dreams.German carmaker BMW officially entered China in 1994, and already has more than 460 suppliers and more than six million customers in China. In 2021, BMW's global sales reached 2.5215 million vehicles, and China's sales reach 846,200 vehicles, accounting for 33.5 percent of the world's total. China is BMW's largest single market.As a member of the delegation of German companies, Chairman of BMW Group Oliver Zipse visited China with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in November 2022. Just seven days after Zipse's visit to China, BMW announced that it will invest 10 billion yuan in the large-scale expansion of power battery production at BMW's Northeast China's Shenyang production base. BMW has also established the largest R&D and innovation layout outside Germany in China based on its investment in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang and Nanjing in East China's Jiangsu Province.There are many multinational companies like BMW that have and will continue to cultivate the Chinese market. They have seen that when the epidemic has clouded the world, China has found an optimal path in dealing with the virus - to firstly get the epidemic under control, partially resumed production and then embarked on the road of a full recovery. They also know that with the establishment of an ideal business environment, implementation of the Foreign Investment Law, and the launch of a national negative list, China's opening-up has reached a new level.Second, a majority of foreign investors are very satisfied with China's high-quality government services. Over the past three years, relevant departments have continued to pay attention to the operating conditions of foreign-funded enterprises in China, actively coordinated resources to help solve difficulties caused by the epidemic, and made every effort to ensure the production and operation of foreign-funded enterprises in China.Take Tesla for example, Tesla China said that its Shanghai plant has still maintained efficient production and excellent output in 2022. According to the 2022 global production and delivery report released by Tesla on January 3, Tesla's annual delivery volume was 1.31 million vehicles, of which the Shanghai Gigafactory delivered over 710,000 vehicles in 2022, accounting for half of the global delivery.Third, the attractiveness of China, as a mega market, is increasingly growing and playing a bigger role. No matter which country the capitals come from, they tend to build factories and R&D centers in China, and follow local market trends to adjust and change marketing strategies and production plans. Over the past three years, although the pandemic has severely impacted the economies of many countries in the world, with some facing risks of a disrupted supply chain, China has effectively controlled the situation and has become one of the most outstanding major economies, attracting more headquarters of multinational companies, as well as R&D centers to settle here.In particular, it needs to be emphasized that foreign companies in China have seen that in the past three years, while fighting the virus, China has firmly implemented high-level opening-up, which serves as a reassurance for all foreign firms in China. Three aspects need to be highlighted in further promoting China's high-level opening-up.First, the principles of fairness, justice and equality. We always believe that as long as a factory or enterprise is established on Chinese territory, no matter whether it is a state-owned enterprise, a private enterprise or a foreign enterprise, it will be treated equally and fairly. This is one of the most important reasons why foreign companies value the Chinese market, and also help improve China's business environment.The Foreign Investment Law, which was officially entered into force in 2020, consolidated the major reform achievements of the foreign investment management system in the form of legislation, clearly granted national treatment to foreign-funded enterprises, and created an institutional environment where domestic and foreign capital are equal. In the Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of a National Unified Market issued by the central government last year, the word ""fairness"" was mentioned 17 times in 30 articles.Second, while doing a good job in deepening the opening-up of goods, services, capital, and talent, high-level opening-up also requires the steady expansion of rules, regulations, management, standards, and other institutional platforms. Take the standard as an example, whoever masters the standard will gain the initiative. We will continue to promote institutional opening-up to drive the formation of a new pattern of reform and opening-up at a higher level.Third, further promote the business environment to be more market-oriented, ruled by law, and internationalized. For each province or autonomous region, or free trade zones, free trade ports, who make sufficient efforts in these aspects, its next step of opening-up can attract more foreign investment.The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) predicts that the global economy will grow by 2.2 percent this year. In 2023, the optimization and adjustment of China's epidemic prevention measures will not only inject new vitality into the global fight against the epidemic, restore the economy, and boost development, but more importantly, it will bring hope and confidence to global development. I believe that China will lead the world with 8 percent economic growth rate this year, which will give great confidence to both developing and developed countries.China will also make greater efforts to promote the development of regional economic integration and inject new impetus into regional and global economic growth. The year of 2023 marks a new beginning for China to develop bilateral, multilateral and regional economic cooperation. More policies to encourage foreign investment will be introduced, including further shortening the negative list, strengthening the protection of intellectual property rights, expanding market access for foreign capital, and increasing the promotion of a market-oriented, legalized, and internationalized business environment. We will also deepen the reform of important areas and key links, and increase the systematic construction of a new development pattern. A domestic market with strong endogenous power will also become the confidence for China's high-level opening-up to the outside world.                         "

They can also be used in medical science as well as cosmetics. About one-third of the preservation of silkworms in the gene pool has practical uses, Dai said. Based on the gene pool, the research group from the Southwest University completed the large-scale analysis of silkworm germplasm resources with the genome of over a thousand silkworms, and digitized the silkworm gene pool for the first time in the world, creating a digital silkworm gene pool and completing the world's first super pan-genome map of silkworms. The pan-genome map of silkworms is also the world's largest long-reads-based pan-genome of the world's plants and animals. It greatly facilitates the research on the genetic basis of important breeding characters and pushed the research on silkworm germplasm resources to the stage of ""molecular design breeding.""According to Dai, the ""molecular design breeding"" of silkworm is to design, optimize, and modify genes at designated sites to create new varieties more in line with new breeding objectives. According to Dai, as an important national platform for silkworm research, the gene pool is expected to promote the scientific protection, fine evaluation, germplasm innovation and variety breeding and application of silkworm genetic resources in the future.                          "

Therefore, he could indirectly control the voting rights represented by Ant's 53.46 percent of shares through the consultancy company.After the adjustment, the two investment firms will independently exercise voting rights. Jack Ma will control 31.04 percent of Ant's shares together with four shareholders via holding 20 percent of the equity interest in one of the investment firms. As a result, his voting power will decline from 53.46 percent to 6.208 percent. After the completion of the adjustment, no shareholder, alone or jointly with other parties, will have control over Ant Group. Individual shareholders can neither control the outcome of the general meeting alone or jointly with others, nor can they nominate the majority of Ant's board of directors. The independent directors will comprise a majority of the company's board after adding the fifth, the company said. Certain members of the management have exited Alibaba Group, aiming to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of Ant's corporate governance and strengthen its independence from Alibaba. The optimization will improve the public attributes of Ant's governance system, and enhance inner management, while strengthening information transparency and optimizing the corporate management structure with checks and balances in equity as Ant's Alipay becomes as a major fi-tech facility, Pan Helin, co-director of the Research Center for Digital Economics and Financial Innovation at Zhejiang University, told the Global Times on Sunday. Pan added that Ant Group should continuously optimize its governance structure while clarifying the legal bottom line.

It could also be a prelude to comprehensive bilateral cooperation this year,"" Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times.According to Chen, Australia and China have shared interests and complementarities in the new-energy sector. Australia has resources and China has advantages in mineral exploitation technologies, while both countries aim to cut carbon emissions.A recent Reuters report noted that China Energy Investment Corp had placed an order to buy coal from Australia in one of the first deals since 2020, another sign of resuming business cooperation.""There are signs that Australian officials are starting to look at long-term development and approaching diplomatic issues from a more pragmatic perspective compared with the Morrison government,"" Chen noted.While the political environment seems to be improving for bilateral economic cooperation, experts warned that Chinese companies need to have contingency plans for further changes in the global lithium industry. Those changes could include the establishment of a ""lithium triangle OPEC"" in certain Latin American countries and pressure from the US. China needs to promote technological progress in the lithium industry chain, seize the opportunity to carry out technological transformation and further reduce dependence on external lithium resources, said Chen Jia, an independent research fellow on international strategy. Upstream merger and acquisition deals are an inevitable stage in the development of the new-energy materials industry, as this field has gone through a period of extensive growth and entered a period of industrial restructuring, he said.""Whether from the perspective of the new-energy industry and supply chain stability or the need for new-energy vehicle makers to control costs, the competition in the new-energy industry chain will further expand to upstream industries,"" Chen Jia noted.

Several leading firms have made efforts to launch carrier rockets.In July 2019, start-up iSpace's carrier rocket sent satellites into orbit from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, a milestone for China's commercial space industry as it was the first private space firm to do so.

But making and sales of such generic drugs are illegal in China.However, despite the illegality, an increasing number of people have still managed to buy the drugs via so-called grey channels in the Chinese mainland.In India, Chinese people familiar with how the generic drugs end up in China say there has been a rise in the sales.""Two weeks ago these drugs are badly sought after, now the demand has eased a bit, but still substantial,"" a former executive at a Chinese company in India told the Global Times on Tuesday.A sales representative at an Indian pharmaceutical company told the Global Times on Tuesday that ""a lot of people from China are buying but the price has dropped down in recent days."" Now the generic version of MSD's Molnupiravir is priced at 850 yuan ($125.49) per single course treatment, down from 1,500 yuan a while ago, the person said.However, as the talks of India-made COVID generic drugs trend on Chinese social media platforms, some Chinese bloggers and industry insiders have warned over the risk of fake drugs.Yin Ye, a top executive with leading Chinese gene company BGI Group, posted on his WeChat account on December 31 that one sample, whose package indicates it is a Primovir made by India's Astrica, has no Nirmatrelvir, the key pharmaceutical ingredient for the generic drug to perform the function of Paxlovid upon laboratory examination at BGI.The pills sourced by Yin's friends from India, instead, contain Oseltamivir, an antiviral drug used to treat flu viruses, Yin wrote.Li Tianquan, co-founder of domestic healthcare big data platform yaozh.com, told the Global Times on Monday that his contacts in the pharmaceutical circle reported similar phenomenon.Li said because generic anti-coronavirus drugs are not compliant with laws and regulations in China and they belong to prescription drugs, he urged the public not to take the risk. He said that the Chinese government can still increase the availability of Paxlovid in China even after the negotiation has failed.Paxlovid is currently covered by China's broad healthcare insurance scheme under temporary measures until the end of March but failing to enter the national medical insurance scheme mean the drug is only available on the private market.Under certain emergency response scheme, the government can procure Paxlovid in a wholesale fashion, which would reduce the price of the drug, Li said.To balance the sole status of Paxlovid as the ""more effective anti-COVID drug"", Li said China will introduce more entrants, such as Japan-developed COVID drug Xocova.Pfizer signed a deal in August for Chinese drug maker Zhejiang Huahai to produce Paxlovid in mainland China solely for local patients.Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Albert Bourla said on Monday at J.P. Morgan's healthcare conference in San Francisco that the company had shipped thousands of courses of the treatment in 2022 to China and in the past couple of weeks, increased that to millions, according to Reuters.Pfizer told the Global Times in a statement that the company and Huahai are actively pushing forward cooperation over localized production of the drug.

By doing so, it can better safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese importers and protect the environment."" Meanwhile, due to rising diplomatic tensions, some Chinese companies also made adjustments to their coal imports from Australia to avoid potential risks.As a result, China's imports of Australian coal in 2021 was 66.37 million tons less than in 2020, a drop of more than 85 percent year-on-year. In the first 11 months of 2022, China's coal imports mainly came from Indonesia, which accounted for 58.3 percent of the total. Russia accounted for 23.3 percent and Mongolia 10 percent, data from industry information provider Lange showed.But as the bilateral relationship, which went through its lowest ebb in decades under Australia's previous government, recently showed improving signs with high-level official exchanges, Australia coal has also regained favor among Chinese companies. The latest move is also a reflection of Chinese companies and traders' restored attention and enthusiasm for expanding business ties with Australia, experts said.Asked about media reports of the Chinese government having notified Chinese companies to expand business ties with Australia, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, on Tuesday referred the question to ""competent authorities.""""What we want to emphasize here is that the Chinese and Australian economies are highly complementary. We hope that the Australian side will work with the Chinese side toward the goal of mutual benefit and win-win results, so as to promote the rebuilding of mutual trust between the two countries and bring the bilateral relationship back on track,"" Wang told a regular press briefing.                          "

The company said it intends to file a form with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) around January 23 and complete the delisting within 10 days thereafter.The company gave several reasons for the decision in the statement, including the fact that it is facing a ""considerable administrative burden"" in meeting the required obligations to maintain the ADS listing in the US.China Southern Airlines Co made similar statements on Friday.Before the announcements, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), the country's top securities regulator, said in December 2022 that China welcomes the latest progress made in China-US audit oversight cooperation.On December 15, the US Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) confirmed that it was able to completely inspect and investigate the accounting firms headquartered in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong in 2022, thus vacating its relevant determinations made in 2021, the Xinhua News Agency reported.The delisting plans came after the agreement on the audit papers, which shows that the US may deliberately create obstacles on this issue, making it difficult for certain companies to implement the agreement reached between the two countries, Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday.Theoretically, after the agreement was reached, such a delisting should not be necessary, which shows that the US has still set up a lot of obstacles, Gao added.In August last year, five Chinese state-owned giants announced plans to delist their ADS from the NYSE, drawing widespread attention amid escalating China-US tensions and constant US crackdowns on Chinese companies, including a push to potentially delist hundreds of Chinese firms in what many called a ""financial decoupling.""Shortly after the announcements, the CSRC said that the companies' decisions were made based on their own commercial considerations. It said it would maintain communication with relevant overseas regulatory agencies to jointly protect the legitimate rights and interests of companies and investors.The delisting plan by the two airlines will be a loss for American and global investors, coming as personnel exchanges have become closer after China eased its travel restrictions, Gao said.It can't have been a sudden decision, as large airlines care about stable operation, said Zhou Mi, an expert with the Research Institute of America and Oceania under the Ministry of Commerce. It shows that Chinese companies still face some risks even after the agreement on auditing, Zhou said.But he said it will be possible for the two firms to rearrange their financing, such as going public in the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong.

The highest rate was set by South China's Hainan Province, usually a tourism hotspot but also increasingly a new frontier for foreign trade, while the lowest was set by North China's Tianjin Municipality.Four of the 31 provinces and regions aim at attaining yearly GDP growth of above 7 percent, while 20 set targets around 6 percent. The average is 5.95 percent, according to Global Times calculations.This means that nearly all the local governments are confident that they can achieve a better-than-expected economic rebounding in 2023 - much better than the forecasts by most foreign institutions and media outlets, which fall between 4.5 and 5.5 percent.""We have full confidence in this year's economic development, since we can see that people's expectations are already recovering. With the continuous optimization of China's COVID strategy and as the coronavirus impact eases, China's economic growth rate is expected to reach an average of 6 percent this year,"" Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, told the Global Times on Monday.Chen Jia, an independent research fellow on international affairs, told the Global Times that China's GDP growth has been ""restrained"" by its prudent macro policy, which means that this year's economic growth could rise further, given financial and fiscal policy fine-tuning.In recent interviews, economists told the Global Times that they're confident that China's development will revive rapidly in early 2023, with GDP growth likely to rebound to more than 5 percent for the year, after the government has pivoted to rejuvenating the economy. According to local governments' 2023 work reports delivered to local people's congresses, most provinces see retail sales and consumption as the primary force to drive this year's economic growth. Almost all of the major provinces and municipalities, including Guangdong, Zhejiang and Shanghai, are putting priority on the expansion of consumption.For example, Guangdong aims to support the consumption of big-ticket items like new-energy vehicles and green and intelligent home appliances.Zhejiang is seeking growth of about 4.5 percent in retail sales, while Beijing plans to nurture digital, cultural, and green consumption, and Shanghai aims to deepen its development as an international consumption center.As China adjusts its supply chains, production capacity in the consumption sector will rise. Combined with the continued optimization of the support policies from the government, consumption will get back to pre-COVID levels in a short time, said Chen Jia.Local governments are also counting on investment to drive growth, with many looking for double-digit growth in fixed-asset investment. Six provinces, including Chongqing and Hainan, have raised their investment targets this year compared with last year, and at least five plan to complete trillion-yuan level investment before the end of 2023.According to Cao, the stabilization of the real estate industry will also improve the overall economy. ""The three-year fight with COVID had an unexpected result -- the rise of China's digital infrastructure. The digital economy has become a new engine for economic growth and will continue to play an important role,"" Cao said.With growing confidence in China's growth prospects this year, experts forecast that this year's global economy needs a strong stabilizer more than ever, and China will fill that role because of its continued opening-up policies, powerful industry chain innovation network, and balanced macroeconomic policies. ""The problem facing Western developed economies is not achieving high-speed growth, but whether they could secure an economic soft landing in the midst of dealing with inflation and other structural problems,"" Chen said.

Especially, the investment in high-tech manufacturing grew by 22.2 percent and that in high-end services up by 12.1 percent year-on-year.""These achievements were extremely difficult given the higher base in 2021 and mounting headwinds like the fallout from COVID-19 resurgences, growing geopolitical tensions and frequent financial tightening overseas,"" Deng Haiqing, chief economist of AVIC Fund Management Co, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Deng attributed the sound outcomes to the government's pro-growth policies, for example, accelerating the construction of major projects, encouraging businesses to invest in upgrades to technology and equipment, and offering more incentives to boost auto sales.In November 2022, a document released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and the National Development and Reform Commission called for structural upgrades and improvements to manufacturing quality, and greater support for sectors such as information technology, artificial intelligence, new energy and high-end equipment.""The better-than-expected results in the country's high-tech sector underscore achievements made through industrial transformation and upgrading, which have become a new impetus for the country's high-quality development,"" Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology, told the Global Times on Tuesday.This year, expanding domestic demand will be important to bolster the economy amid continuously softening overseas demand, with infrastructure investment to continue to drive stable economic growth, Deng said, noting that budget spending in 2023 may surpass last year's level.The annual Central Economic Work Conference held in December stressed that the proactive fiscal policy should be stepped up for its effectiveness, with a better mix of tools including fiscal deficits, special-purpose bonds and interest subsidies.UBS economists led by Wang Tao wrote in a note sent to the Global Times that the deficit ratio may be raised to 3 percent of GDP, and special-purpose bond issues may rise to 3.7-3.8 trillion yuan to support infrastructure investment.The central bank has vowed to use varied monetary policy tools to maintain reasonably ample liquidity in 2023, which will attract more foreign direct investment to the country's capital market amid the rising possibility of bubbles bursting in Western economies.""Both infrastructure investment and private investment will be greatly ramped up in 2023, if the expectations for GDP growth could recover to pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019,"" Dong said.

The earnings report showed that Tesla achieved a revenue of $24.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 37 percent year-on-year. Its net profit reached $3.69 billion, up 59 percent year-on-year.The financial report shows that the Shanghai plant remains Tesla's primary export center, supporting almost all markets except North America.In 2022, Tesla's annual delivery volume was 1.31 million vehicles, of which the Shanghai Gigafactory delivered over 710,000 vehicles in 2022, accounting for half of its global delivery.According to the financial report, Tesla's annual production capacity has reached 1.8 million units of Model Y/Model 3 per year, and the Shanghai plant has already exceeded 750,000 of Model 3/Model Y per year; its first plant in California has an annual capacity of 550,000 units of Model Y/Model 3.For the full year, the auto manufacturer achieved a revenue of $81.46 billion in 2022, rising 51 percent compared with 2021, with net income totaling $12.56 billion, soaring 128 percent.Tesla expects to deliver 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, which would be a 37 percent increase from 2022.

Despite the tough situation, the nation has managed to stabilize energy production and supply, with more efforts being put in place, experts said, refuting some foreign media allegations that power curbs are being implemented in some parts of the country.In a notice issued by SASAC, electricity suppliers are urged to better respond to market demand and rule out any possibility of power curbs, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Friday. Companies must further add to coal inventories while continuously upgrading their production capacity, the notice said.Price stability remains the key focus in the supply side, with companies asked to actively implement medium- and long-term price mechanism and unleash advanced production capacity at the earliest opportunity, according to the notice.The notice is part of a series of efforts made by the government to beef up energy security, which is always a major focus for its direct connection to the public's livelihood and business operations. Major breakthroughs have been made in energy supply for the winter.For example, as of mid-January, PetroChina had supplied more than 57 billion cubic meters of natural gas to the market in this round of winter supply, accounting for more than 60 percent of the country's gas supply, with the highest daily gas supply reaching 836 million cubic meters, a record high.The ramped-up efforts in imports, self-production and facility upgrades are some of the key factors that have contributed to the growth.Thanks to the government's measures, China's production and supplies for coal, natural gas and electricity supply all witnessed a positive growth in 2022, despite the tightened energy situation in many parts of the world.However, choosing to ignore the achievements that China has made in securing energy supplies, some foreign media recently made allegations regarding power curbs in some parts of northern China this winter due to so-called ""gas supply shortages and purchase limits,"" with Hebei Province in Northern China being a main example. Such claims were immediately denied by several industry insiders reached by the Global Times on Friday.Hebei Natural Gas Company, a major player in the regional energy supplies, told the Global Times on Friday that there have been no power curbs or purchase limits on gas, nor would there be in the future.Xinao Gas Baoding Branch Co, which covers up to 80 percent of the gas supply in Baoding, Hebei and some surrounding regions, said that there were neither power curbs nor purchase limits, while there has been some tightened power supply, which only occurred temporarily in certain places in mid-December.""Because of the tightened supply in the upper stream market, there was not enough gas to keep the indoor temperature at the required level at certain compounds on some days in mid-December last year,"" an employee surnamed Liu of Xinao Gas Baoding Co told the Global Times on Friday.The company was in active coordination with the suppliers and the situation was immediately resolved.""At present, except certain scheduled mending for facilities that required temporary gas supply suspension, which normally lasted just a few hours, there has been no problem from the supply side,"" she said.While gas prices in Europe are several times higher than the average of the past decade, as media reported, posing challenges to global price stability, the price in China remains largely stable.In Baoding, for example, the price is at around 2.7 yuan ($0.4) per cubic meter for about a year, thanks to the government's subsidies and other measures that stabilized price and supply, according to Liu.The domestic energy industry structure, with state-owned companies being the main drive, also enables the country to respond efficiently to market needs.With regard to China's energy supply, the centrally-administered state-owned enterprises are responsible for up to 90 percent of the oil and gas supply, more than 60 percent of electricity supply, and over 25 percent of coal supply, according to media reports.""China has done adequate work in securing energy supply for the winter, so even though there might be some tightening, it will only be temporary and partial,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Friday.Moreover, although gas supply has been used for winter heating as the country makes its transition toward clean energy, it still plays a limited and balanced role together with coal, especially in northern China, Lin said. The latter has also had adequate inventories and supply amid the country's efforts to expand import and production.                         "
Company,By Reuters  |  2023/1/27 21:41:00,Traditional automakers face daunting challenges from new-energy players,Global automakers have long experienced periods of feast and famine that come on roughly seven-to-ten year cycles.

He must accelerate the Japanese automaker's efforts to develop more competitive electric vehicles. But he will get little breathing room from Tesla or the Chinese EV manufacturers who are using their leads in EV technology and production costs to slash prices.Tesla already earns roughly seven times as much per vehicle as Toyota. Its 17-percent-pretax margins are roughly double the average for the rest of the industry. And after a rough 2022 for the company's shares, the stock has opened 2023 by gaining 28 percent Musk hinted again on Wednesday that Tesla is working on a new vehicle that could sell profitably for under $30,000 - which would compete head-on with mass market models from Toyota, Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co.Musk has in the past teased products that took far longer to deliver than he initially promised, such as the long-delayed Cybertruck.But the Tesla chief's ambitions are clear: To reorder the auto industry hierarchy that for decades placed Toyota at the top.""I don't think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can't,"" Musk said when asked how the auto industry could look in five years.Global automakers have long experienced periods of feast and famine that come on roughly seven-to-ten year cycles. What is happening now is different.The shocks of the pandemic, two years of supply-chain chaos and possibly a recession this year are colliding with a once-in-a-century shift of the industry's fundamental technology.As combustion vehicles give way to electric vehicles with high-powered computer chips for brains, many of the advantages of incumbency that Toyota enjoyed are now withering away.The shift to electric, computerized and software-driven vehicles has opened the door for Tesla and other startups, particularly in China, to re-set the ground rules for competition. Tesla's price war could be just the start.""We question whether competitors can keep up in this EV race,"" Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note this week.Incumbent automakers can no longer count on refinement of mature vehicle technology to stay competitive. Established automakers are investing heavily in EVs - some with more speed and more success than others.South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co on Thursday reported better-than-expected results powered in part by strong sales of its new EV lineup. Hyundai forecast its EV sales would grow by 54 percent this year - a faster growth pace than Tesla has forecast.Chinese manufacturers pouring EVs into Europe have as much as a 10,000 euro cost advantage ($10,600), Patrick Koller, chief executive of auto supplier Forvia, said earlier this month.The intensifying competition puts pressure on Renault and Nissan to resolve negotiations to restructure their alliance. The companies are now aiming to announce a deal - including an investment by Nissan in Renault's EV unit - by February 6, sources said.Renault and Nissan once argued that their alliance gave them significant advantages in economies of scale. That potential still exists. But first they will have to fight to stay at their current size as Tesla and Chinese manufacturers try to eat away at their sales.""Even though the market is shrinking, we're growing and EVs have doubled almost year-over-year,"" Tesla Vice President Lars Moravy told analysts on Wednesday. ""We always look at it as how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we're just going to keep growing in that space. There's 95 percent for us to go get.""                         "

However, experts said that the latest US move and more potential containment won't beat down China, as Chinese semiconductor firms are making all efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies for self-reliance.The US has reached an agreement with the Netherlands and Japan to restrict exports of some advanced chipmaking machinery to China, including advanced lithography tools, Bloomberg reported on Saturday, citing sources.The deal would extend some export controls the US adopted in October 2022 to companies in the two countries, including ASML Holding NV, Nikon Corp and Tokyo Electron Ltd, according to the report. The actual implementation of those restrictions could take months as the two countries finalize legal arrangements, it said.Despite mounting US pressure on export curbs, Netherland's leading lithography firm ASML said these measures would not have a material effect on the company's announced expectations for 2023.""Our business in China is predominantly directed at mature nodes,"" ASML said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Saturday. ""Meanwhile, ASML's business activities globally will continue. What we need now is stability and reliability in our industry to avoid further disturbances in the global semiconductor industry,"" it said.ASML will continue to engage with the authorities to inform them about the potential impact of any proposed rule in order to assess the impact on the global semiconductor supply chain, the company said.Nikon and Tokyo Electron didn't reply on Saturday.The Biden administration has repeatedly claimed steps for its so-called chip alliance over the past year, but little progress had been made. In terms of the deal with the Netherlands and Japan, no details have yet been announced.The latest US moves are unlikely to have any significant additional long-term impact on the Chinese semiconductor industry, which has withstood the US' multi-year unilateral crackdowns, Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom analyst, told the Global Times on Saturday.Given their massive revenue from the Chinese market, the Netherlands and Japan as well as their companies like ASML are unlikely to comply with the US' order to curb sales of chip machinery to China, Ma said.The global semiconductor industrial chain is one that embodies broad collaboration and global division of labor, and China is already the world's largest semiconductor consumption market. According to data from industry body SEMI, sales of semiconductor equipment in the Chinese mainland reached $29.62 billion in 2021, accounting for almost 29 percent of the global market. In the second quarter of 2022, the sales in the Chinese mainland recorded $6.56 billion and that of the global market totaled 26.43 $billion, data from China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) showed.However, the US is pushing forward ""tech decoupling"" with China at a speed faster than many anticipated, and it's aiming to draw all allies to join its tech war against China. In this regard, experts said China should continue to improve its own tech capabilities to deal with the possible deterioration arising from the US' containment.""The US' continuous moves send a sober warning to Chinese semiconductor makers that the US won't stop its chip war against China. It's time for domestic firms to concentrate their resources and efforts to seek technological breakthroughs,"" Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Saturday.""There is no mystery to lithography tools. Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (Group) Co has developed a machine with limited capital investment and already has market demand. I believe we will definitely make tech breakthroughs with nationwide resources,"" Xiang said.""It won't take years for China to independently develop lithography tools,"" he said. The US' push toward tech decoupling has greatly boosted the application of domestically made chips by Chinese smart device manufacturers, which incentivizes local chip firms to make technological improvements. Meanwhile, China has been ramping up efforts in nurturing chip talent.China's semiconductor sector has been developing fast despite the US pressure, especially in terms of the mass production of 28-nanometer chips. Ma said domestic semiconductor firms have been able to independently produce the widely used 28-nm chips and are ramping up efforts to make breakthroughs in advanced 14-nm chips.Chinese tech giants are constantly making breakthroughs in chip technology. Take Huawei as an example. Its goal has been very clear, which is to address the existing chip supply problems by increasing input in research and development based on the actual conditions of the domestic chip sector.

It marked the first direct flight from China to Bali since the start of the pandemic. A welcome ceremony was held at the airport by the Indonesian tourism ministry and the Bali provincial government to greet the Chinese tourists.The Southeast Asian country has set a target of more than 250,000 travelers from China this year, Indonesian Minister for Tourism and Creative Economy Sandiaga Uno revealed Tuesday at a press conference, according to Xinhua.In the Philippines, about 190 visitors from Xiamen, East China's Fujian Province, who arrived at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport on Tuesday, the third day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, were welcomed by government officials.""The arrival of Chinese tourists to the Philippines brings a very positive impact for the prospects of the Philippine tourism industry,"" said Philippine Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco Tuesday at the airport, according to Philippine News Agency. Frasco was joined by Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian.The reopening of outbound travel arguably rekindles hopes for these Southeast Asian nations of rebooting their virus-plagued tourism sectors that had previously relished the inflow of Chinese passengers.Throughout the weeklong festival, Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Chiangmai, Manila and the resort island of Bali, among others, made the list of the most popular transnational travel destinations among Chinese passengers. Bookings of flights to Bali skyrocketed 30-fold year-on-year over the holiday, while that of Singapore-bound flights rose by more than eight times. As measured by hotel bookings, Bangkok hotels saw a 33-fold surge over the holiday, while spending per hotel booking increased by around 70 percent, Trip.com Group figures revealed.Similar trends were evidenced by data from other travel platforms. Outbound flight bookings rose 6.7 times over the Spring Festival over the 2022 level. Among the top five destinations were Thailand, China's Hong Kong, Malaysia, the US and Indonesia, online travel service provider Qunar said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Friday. Along with increased flight availability and an improved viral response, bookings of international flights and hotels are expected to continue seeing an uptrend, according to estimates by Qunar.Thailand sat atop the overseas destination rankings in terms of bookings, followed by New Zealand, Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines, domestic travel services and social-networking platform Mafengwo said in a statement sent to the Global Times.The stellar numbers over the holiday were considered to be a prelude to the continued revival of outbound travel later this year, as domestic travel agencies and online travel businesses were green-lit to resume pilot outbound group tours to a selection of countries and regions starting February 6. A large number of passengers planning to stagger the outbound travel rush are contemplating outbound trips after the Spring Festival, read the Mafengwo statement.

Company,By Global Times  |  2023/1/31 14:55:43,Tax and fee-cut policy largely sustainable heading into 2023,The Chinese government has been cutting taxes and fees since 2018 in an attempt to reduce the financial burden on enterprises so they can expand their businesses and boost the economy. ,https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2021/2021-08-02/4c08a9c0-0e62-4a22-ac81-e087cdf1de0d.jpeg," The Chinese government has been cutting taxes and fees since 2018 in an attempt to reduce the financial burden on enterprises so they can expand their businesses and boost the economy. Since 2021, the Central Economic Work Conference encouraged more value-added tax (VAT) credit refunds to maintain micro-economic stability.Comprising tax cuts and VAT credit refunds, the favorable package has become an important part of China's microeconomic and fiscal policy, which is aimed at deepening supply-side structural reform, promoting high-quality development, easing the burden on enterprises and energizing all types of market players in the country.Also on Monday, the Ministry of Finance said that it will further improve the tax and fee reduction measures, while comprehensively considering the financial affordability and the needs of providing fiscal assistance to support businesses.According to the State Taxation Administration, as of the end of November, 2022, combined new tax and fee reductions, VAT credit refunds, and tax and fee deferrals exceeded 3.7 trillion yuan ($539 billion). Among them, taxpayers enjoyed 789.6 billion yuan in tax cuts, more than 2.3 trillion yuan in VAT credit refunds — 3.5 times that of last year — and 679.7 billion yuan in tax and fee deferrals.These favorable policies have increased cash flow for small and medium-sized enterprises, substantially easing the pressure on them and offering them an opportunity to boost their competitiveness and promote innovation.But the tax and fee cuts also have increased the government's fiscal burden, particularly as governments at all levels are under growing financial pressure due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the almost three years since the pandemic first emerged, the revenues of the central, provincial, city and local governments have increased on average by only 1.27 percent. In contrast, the growth rate of tax and fee cuts was as high as 62.95 percent during the same period, meaning it has become increasingly difficult for fiscal revenue to support the tax and fee cut policy.But the above difficulties are temporary, and are linked to the severity and length of the pandemic. With the easing of the anti-pandemic policy, China's economy is expected to return to a strong growth trajectory and be able to sustain the tax and fee reduction policy this year.Take for example the VAT credit refunds, which accounts for the biggest percentage of the total sum. By refunding taxes on goods that haven't been sold, VAT credit refunds can ease the constraints created by the slow trickle of cash by companies, ensure money is circulated through the domestic economy, and improve the efficiency of capital.As the economy recovers, enterprises with unsold goods will soon clear their inventories and make a profit and therefore can help return the early tax to the government. Thus, VAT credit refunds will provide timely support to the companies hit hard by the pandemic, experts said.From April to September last year, 55 percent of enterprises have repaid part of the early tax refunds and 26 percent have repaid the full amount. The manufacturing, wholesale and retail sectors have done better than the transportation and hospitality industries in terms of repaying the tax refunds. For example, by the end of September, companies had repaid about 200 billion yuan, representing only 10 percent of the previous tax refunds, to the tax authorities.The good news is that it is relatively easy for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) to repay the tax refunds more quickly. Despite being a mainstay of tax reimbursements, MSMEs have gradually emerged out of trouble and spurred the market. In turn they can contribute to the fiscal revenue by paying due taxes in the future.And, China needs to further improve its tax and fee reduction program, and implement proactive fiscal policy to energize enterprises, particularly MSMEs, experts said.First, it is important to use algorithms to help governments at all levels monitor tax reimbursements, and conduct stress tests on finance to reduce risks and safeguard the public interest. And national and provincial fiscal departments should share the cost of tax refunds for some poor areas in cities and counties, and ease their financial strains.Second, it is important to support MSMEs using VAT credit refunds. The policy has proved highly effective for MSMEs, for many of them have overcome the odds, with some paying back the tax and credit refunds. VAT credit refunds have the potential to not only alleviate the hardships of MSMEs, but also make fiscal policy more sustainable.Third, there is a need to strengthen supervision over larger businesses to ensure the tax and credit refunds can be recovered fully and in a timely manner. Some companies have significantly benefited from generous amounts of tax and credit refunds but paid little to tax and financial authorities, making the tax and fee cut policy financially unsustainable. Therefore, strict supervision of enterprises is needed to root out potential risks and ensure repayments are made on time, experts said.Global Times                         "

The fossil was found in the stratum of the Early Cretaceous period in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. 
",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-14/d6af37fb-863d-418d-8597-530f02c71a65.jpeg," Scientists from China and abroad announced on Tuesday the discovery of a very rare fossil of a freshwater aquatic reptile. The fossil was found in the stratum of the Early Cretaceous period in Northeast China's Liaoning Province. The reptile of the species Hyphalosaurus, also known as Sinohydrosaurus, meaning ""submerged lizard,"" used to live in a large quantity in the fresh water in the western part of Liaoning during the Early Cretaceous period. The reptiles with a small flattened skull and a long neck belonged taxonomically to the extinct order of Choristodera. It was a semiaquatic diapsid reptile which lived in Asia, Europe and North America about 170 million years ago. Since the 1980s, a large number of Choristodera fossils have been discovered in successions within the territory of the country. The earliest fossils of Hyphalosaurus lingyuanensis on record came from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation in Lingyuan city, Liaoning. Yixian Formation is the volcanic sedimentary rock that preserves a large number of fossils of the Jehol Biota, the organisms that lived in Early Cretaceous volcanic-influenced environments, including northeastern China. The genus Hyphalosaurus contains two species, H. lingyuanensis and H. baitaigouensis, both from the Yixian Formation of Liaoning Province. They both got their names from where they came from. They are similar in appearance but different in the number of vertebrae. Despite the abundance of Hyphalosaurus fossils discovered, there so far have been only two cases with skin details recorded. Both the specimens contain only partial epidermis on their trunks and tails, without providing more details. In 2019, a research team led by Xing Lida, associate professor from China University of Geosciences in Beijing conducted a joint research on a Hyphalosaurus fossil collected by the Yingliang Stone Natural History Museum in East China's Fujian Province. The Hyphalosaurus fossil has a length of nearly 1.1 meters, with 19 cervical vertebrae, 16 dorsal vertebrae, three sacral vertebrae and at least 56 caudal vertebrae, which belongs to the H. lingyuanensis species. The fossil has a significant research value with the soft tissue of skin being very well preserved in the form of carbonaceous membranes (or lamination), despite that the bones were severely flattened during the fossilization process, providing more information about the appearance of this specialized aquatic reptile. The fossil preserved in two separate matrices reveals the ventral epidermis of the individual H. lingyuanensis species, showing the diversity of scale types of the nearly entire body. The dark skin carbonaceous membranes are distributed everywhere including the specimen's head, neck, shoulder, left forelimb, double hind limb, torso and tail. It was estimated that the exposed skin areas of the specimens exhibit five major scale shapes including rectangular, square, diamond, polygon and oval shapes. Besides, traces of skin carbonaceous membranes extending to the base of the middle phalanx provide strong new evidence that the H. lingyuanensis species had webbed feet. Moreover, compared with that of the neck and body, the skin area on the tail of the specimen is much wider, sort of like the tail of fish, which the research team inferred that the H. lingyuanensis used its tail to propel itself forward in the water. Generally speaking, the Yingliang specimen of H. lingyuanensis reveals a much more diversified scale pattern than before, which reinforced our understanding of this species of animal and greatly increased the knowledge of the diversity of currently known skin patterns of ancient aquatic reptiles. The research paper has been published in Cretaceous Research, the international scientific journal on palaeontology. Global Times                         "

He spoke highly of China-Germany relations, saying that the two countries have strong foundations for cooperation.The 54-year-old senior executive is planning to visit four Chinese cities that are home to Volkswagen's major production bases and cooperative partners. The four cities are Shanghai, Beijing, Hefei and Changchun.He disclosed that his major job in the coming few days will be communicating with Chinese consumers, business partners and employees, so as to better understand the development trend of China's frontier technologies, and the changes in Chinese people's expectations. He also aims to seek new potential cooperative partners.Blume is one of a series of senior executives from German car giants that have planned a China visit shortly after the country's economic reopening. The Global Times also learned from sources that Jaguar Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz Group's senior executives have plans to visit China soon.Last November, Blume joined a high-ranking German delegation led by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on a trip to China.According to Blume, Scholz's visit to China was very important because it let both sides understand their ideas and opportunities.He said that China and Germany have a strong basis for cooperation, and the two sides will continue the win-win cooperative relationship. He also revealed to the Global Times that the German government is having discussions on relevant documents in terms of their new strategy toward China.Volkswagen supports fair global trade development, and has a clear strategy to conduct investment and cooperation in China regarding both products and technologies, he said.China's automobile market, especially the new-energy vehicle (NEV) market developed fast last year in spite of the coronavirus. Data revealed by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology showed that NEV cars sold by domestic brands accounted for 79.9 percent of China's overall NEV market in 2022, which shows the fierce competition faced by overseas brands like VW.Blume nevertheless has an open mind toward such competition, saying he is excited to see that the Chinese market is so active and that it plays a role of fueling world innovation. He said that China has around 50 testing grounds for autonomous cars, which he thinks have great potential for development in the country.Blume also expressed optimism for the prospects of the Chinese market in 2023, saying that there will be positive growth. In particular, the market might see a strong rebound in the second half, he predicted.                         "

Despite the US government' reckless decoupling attempt aimed at containing China's economic growth, the gravity of the global economy is now moving from the east of Pacific to the west of the ocean.The speedy recovery of China will have considerable implications for the world, lifting the boat of those countries sitting together and economically integrated with China. Nearly all China's neighbors will benefit greatly, the ASEAN economies in particular. China's prompt move to drop COVID restrictions and reopen its borders is re-energizing the global market of industrial materials too. Since the beginning of January, prices for copper, aluminum and zinc have all had their best start to a year in 11 years, rallying by an average of 13 percent, according to data provided by the London Metal Exchange. Tin, which is largely used to make electronics, has soared 30 percent, its sharpest rise in 32 years. Fixed-asset investment and domestic consumption will be the two leading driving forces propelling growth this year. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Saturday presided the first post-holiday executive meeting of the State Council, calling for intensified efforts to ""expedite consumption recovery"" and keep investment and foreign trade basically stable, according to an official readout.Domestic consumption was significantly up during the seven-day Spring Festival holidays that ended on Friday - thanks to the government's grand reopening which saw coronavirus infections quickly peaked throughout the country in early January. National tourism revenues surged by more than 33 percent during the seven days from last year to reach 375.8 billion yuan, new data showed.One crucial task facing the government in its bid to gear up domestic consumption is ensuring workers feel confident in their future incomes. So, it is necessary for the government and corporate employers to work together to raise the salary levels of Chinese workers across the board. Immediately after the Spring Festival holidays, all provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in the country moved to roll up their sleeves to pursue higher local GDP growth rates in 2023, with the coastal powerhouses including Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces as well as Shanghai vowing to achieve annual 5-6 percent economic growths. South China's Hainan Province, the largest free trade zone in the country, aims to attain nine percent GDP growth this year.Some provincial-level governments have announced incentive measures, including fostering high-quality development and optimizing local business environment to inspire faster development in 2023 and spur quick recovery from the impact of the pandemic. The actions will give a strong boost to the overall economic growth. Last year, the country saw one of the slowest years of economic growth of 3 percent since 2008 when the US subprime loans meltdown caused the global financial crisis.An action plan consisting of 10 implementation lines was released by the Shanghai municipal government. According to the plan, three tasks, boosting confidence, expanding market demand, and seeking stable growth, are imperative, with China's largest industrial city aiming to achieve above five percent GDP growth this year. Meanwhile, the government needs to strengthen coordination of fiscal and monetary policies and help ease economic burdens on pandemic-hit broad service sectors and medium and small-size private enterprises. At the same time, China has intensified infrastructure build-up and urban housing construction to help drive economic revival. The strong start of infrastructure projects is more of continuing the momentum that has picked up pace since the fourth quarter last year. The National Development and Reform Commission, the top economic planner of China, said it approved a total of 109 fixed-asset investment projects in late 2022.

Though it has remained in contraction territory for six consecutive months, businesses have become more optimistic, a survey revealed.The Caixin PMI tracks small and private-sector manufacturers in China. According to the survey, China's recent adjustment of COVID-19 response significantly eased pressure on the manufacturing in January. Output fell at the softest pace in five months, while the downturn in new orders moderated, the survey found. Wang Zhe, a senior economist at Caixin Insight Group, said that both manufacturing supply and demand continued to shrink in January impacted by COVID-19 infections. Output shrank for the fifth straight month while total new orders shrank for the sixth straight month, but the contraction was milder than in December.""Due to mounting recession risks overseas, external demand was weak, with the reading for new export orders contracting for the sixth consecutive month,"" Wang said.Though the figure remained under the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction, ""when considering the 12-month outlook for output, firms expressed the strongest optimism since May 2021, supported by hopes that economic conditions and new business will rebound,"" the survey said.Supply chains moved closer to stabilization at the start of 2023, with average lead times for inputs increasing only slightly. While the survey noted that pressure had receded, ""logistics had yet to recover fully in some areas amid worker shortages.""Overall, the pandemic continued to take a toll on the economy in January, Wang said, but optimism continued to improve as businesses look toward a post-COVID economic revival. ""After being hit by the latest wave of infections, the focus of economic work should be on accelerating economic recovery and promoting normalized production and social order,"" Wang said.The Caixin PMI trend is generally in line with the official PMI data released on Tuesday.

The entry of Douyin into the online supermarket will increase the competition in the already hotly contested e-commerce sector, experts said.Douyin Supermarket went live right after the Chinese New Year holidays, Beijing Daily reported.After searching for Douyin Supermarket in the Douyin app, users can shop online from a variety of categories, ranging from snacks and household necessities to personal care and cosmetics.Douyin’s supermarket said it offers guaranteed delivery service and promises the authenticity of all its products in addition to hassle-free after-sale services, according to its introduction page. It also promised same-day shipping if consumers pay before 16:00 pm. In its payment interface, Douyin is offering discount to users who choose to pay with Douyin’s own payment tool, while Tencent’s WeChat payment function is folded and hidden.The launch of the new function aligns with the expansion strategy of the platform, Liu Dingding, an independent tech industry analyst told the Global Times on Wednesday.The competitiveness of Douyin lies in its user base, traffic and algorithms. It can connect users and products in a highly efficient way, Liu said.“If the Douyin can made good use of live-streaming and its algorithms, the platform is expected to be one of the top players in e-commerce in the future,” Liu said.Thanks to its huge user base, Douyin has made rapid progress in e-commerce in the past two years since it officially set up an e-commerce division in 2020.On May 31, Douyin disclosed that its gross merchandises value (GMV) from May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022 increased by 3.2 times from a year ago, without revealing concrete figures, 36kr reported.As previously reported by 36kr, Douyin’s e-commerce business is expected to reach 1.3 - 1.5 trillion yuan in GMV in 2022. In comparison, it took Alibaba 10 years and JD.com 13 years to cross the one-trillion GMV level.Given its late entrance into the market, a relatively “weaker supply ability and brand influence” will be its weakness in competing with the country’s major players such as Tmall and JD.com, Liu said.China's online retail sales expanded by 4 percent year-on year in 2022 to reach 13.8 trillion yuan, the National Bureau of Statistics said.                          "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2021/2021-04-03/8459ffa0-b1ad-4bf7-adfe-33b9cbd52446.jpeg," A recent survey conducted by the  Global Times Research Center with 405 mid and senior-level executives from domestic and overseas companies showed that more than half of the respondents are either very or relatively confident of China's economic recovery in the next three years, higher than their confidence in Asian and global markets, reflecting the buoyed sentiment among global businesses as Chinese economy rebounds at a faster-than-expected speed following optimization of COVID measures. The survey also offers a vivid glimpse into how the business community views challenges hanging over the Chinese and global economy, with trade protectionism being a major trigger of worries for company executives. The respondents came from a total of 18 industries ranging from IT, tourism to medical and aviation; 35 of the respondents are top directors of their companies, while 90 are senior management staff.A closer look at detailed data in the survey shows that businesses' confidence in prospects of Chinese economy is very solid, as their responses to several questions about their outlook on Chinese economy all point toward a relatively high level of optimism.To sum up, the surveyed companies believe China will stand out among Asian economies in terms of economic recovery, and that the Asian economy will recover at a faster speed than the whole world. About 57 percent of the executives said they are ""very"" or ""relatively"" confident of China's economic recovery in the next three years. Among the foreign company executives who have been surveyed, about 49 percent shared this viewpoint.In comparison, about 41 percent of the overall respondents are very or relatively confident of Asian economic recovery, while only 27 percent expressed such confidence when it comes to global recovery prospects in the next three years. In the long run, the respondents' outlook about China's economic prospects also outweighs their expectations for the global economic future. According to the survey, about 25 percent of the respondents think that China's economy will develop fast in the next five years, while only 5.7 percent of them share the same view for the global economy.One thing worth noticing is that the survey was the survey was conducted from December 12, 2022 to January 9, after the Chinese government optimized its coronavirus management measures and when COVID infections were sweeping across certain regions in the country. It further testifies that the businesses' confidence in domestic economy is unshaken by short-term fluctuations.""Although some of China's major economic indicators have dropped in the past period, we believe that the fundamentals for Chinese economy's long-term stabilization and improvement have not changed, and the characteristics of Chinese market being strongly resilient and having great potential have never changed either,"" Chen Changyao, General Manager of Qatar Airways North Asia, told the Global Times. Chen said the global aviation and tourism industry ""always expects"" recovery of the Chinese market.China's ensuing economic data in January also confirmed a trend of economic rebound like what the executives have anticipated. Both China's manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) bounced back into the expansion territory in January for the first time since last September, signaling recovery in the production and service sectors. The recent Spring Festival holidays also witnessed a strong rebound in consumption fields ranging from tourism to the movie industry.Jia Guolong, chairman of Chinese catering giant Xibei Catering Group, told the Global Times that he thought the coronavirus uncertainties have gradually ended, and the next phase will further test companies' cash flow, while a recovery on the market can be expected to return gradually. ""In our eyes, industries that have been affected by the coronavirus, including dining, have seen the twilight. The market will continue to recover and will surely usher in new development opportunities,"" Jia said. The survey showed that around 38 percent of the respondents forecast that China's GDP will grow between 3-5 percent, while 32 percent think the growth will fall between 5-7 percent. On average, their forecast for China's GDP in 2023 is 4.64 percent. The IMF on Monday projected China's economy will grow by 5.2 percent in 2023, 0.8 percentage points higher than its forecast last October. It forecast that global economy will grow by 2.9 percent this year. On the other hand, the survey's statistics also showed China's economic resilience in the year of 2022 despite coronavirus impact. About 36 percent of the respondents said that their companies' revenue in 2022 was better than the previous year, while nearly one third said they earned a higher salary. On the other hand, both the respondents and experts still hold cautious views about the world's economic development trends in 2023, citing challenges like high raw material costs and instable supply chains.Chen Jia, an independent macroeconomic analyst, said although the US' economic indicators in the fourth quarter are better than expectations, the risks of an economic hard landing still exist for reasons like that the negative impact of shrinking US private fixed-assets investment on US economy is still increasing.He also noted that Europe has so far not walked out of stagnation risks, while South Korea and Japan are having strong currency fluctuations.In particular, the business cycle has expressed worries over the potential influence of protectionism on the global economy. A total of 165, or 40.7 percent of the respondents think that the global spread of trade protectionism will restrict global economic development in 2023. And more than half of them think trade protectionism will form great constraints on global economic recovery, while 26.7 percent think that the trend will severely harm the global economy.Besides, about 44 percent of the respondents think that the US' financial regulation/monetary policy and trend to politicize economic/trade cooperation will also restrict global economic development this year.The US has repeatedly taken action to strangle the development of Chinese companies in recent years. In a latest move, the US administration has reportedly stopped approving licenses for US companies to export most items to China's Huawei.According to Chen Jia, the US' moves such as decoupling action and sanctions against China have brought disaster to the US and the world economy. ""The US needs 'friends' to help it avoid a possible economic hard landing this year. It should reexamine and adjust its position as soon as possible to stop economic losses,"" he said.The surveyed businesses also saw some challenges for China's economic recovery, with global economic slump and lingering epidemic being considered the two biggest lurking risks for China in 2023.Chen Changyao said that phased outbreaks of the coronavirus epidemic still have a (negative) impact on production and life, which is also a major test for airline companies' capacity guarantee, operation, service abilities and resilience to pressure.Fan Dongsheng, general manager of the China Tourism Group Hotel Holding Co, also told the Global Times that financial risk is still the major risk that companies need to guard against for some time to come, and it will be the top priority for companies to prevent blind capital expansion, effectively use investment tools to drive company development, and reasonably control the assets-liability ratio.                          "

According to the office of the State Council leading group for SOE reform, about 13,000 subsidiary enterprises of centrally administered SOEs and about 25,000 subsidiary enterprises of locally administered SOEs have established boards of directors.To build a standard board of directors is a key link in forging a modern corporate system for the SOEs.As a highlight of the reform push, the reform of the corporate system has been completed comprehensively, a historic breakthrough that further consolidated the legal basis for the SOEs to participate in competition as independent market players.Meanwhile, the tenure and contractual management for managers has been promoted across the SOEs, covering over 80,000 enterprises and 220,000 people.Zhang Yuzhuo, Party secretary of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, said the SOEs will focus on strategic security, the national economy and people's livelihoods, and public services, while fostering strategic emerging industries to better play a leading role in building a modern industrial system.In the past three years, work has been done to integrate the leadership of the Communist Party of China with corporate governance in SOEs, highlight their role as market entities, and advance system reform, said a conference on the three-year action plan held Tuesday.The SOEs have become leaner and healthier, their system to encourage technological innovation has been improved, and supervision over state assets has become more professional, systematic and law-based, it said.The SOEs raked in 82.6 trillion yuan ($12.2 trillion) in operating revenues in 2022, up 8.3 percent from the previous year, data from the Ministry of Finance showed.Xinhua                         "

The main difference this time is the change in focus from the alleged ""debt trap"" to the alleged ""construction flaws.""

The main difference this time is the change in focus from the alleged ""debt trap"" to the alleged ""construction flaws.""The allegations, claiming the project contains many crackers that may lead to its breakdown, have elicited immediate responses from officials at the Chinese Embassy in Ecuador, the participating companies, and experts, with sound evidence and a clear stance, providing a full picture of the project and others that Western media has attempted to overlook.On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the BRI, the Wall Street Journal on January 20 published a long article with an appalling headline and distorted information in a bid to discredit China's overseas infrastructure projects. In the report, the CCS hydroelectric plant in Ecuador is used as an example in an attempt to support claims that it has some construction flaws.The report claimed that ""thousands of cracks have emerged in the hydroelectric plant,"" suggesting that ""the project could break down,"" citing random experts, without providing strong evidence to back up such claims.Chinese government officials, companies, and experts refuted this report for ignoring facts about the project.In an exclusive interview with the Global Times on Wednesday, the Chinese Embassy in Ecuador said that the relevant reports do not give the full picture of the situation.Regarding the partial cracks in the hydropower project, the embassy said that this problem has been investigated by an international third-party independent inspection and evaluation agency TUV SUD based in Germany, with the conclusion that it will not affect the operation and safety of the unit.The power station will be safe within the design life of 50 years, the embassy said.Contrary to the groundless accusation, the CCS hydroelectric plant's contribution to improving local people's livelihoods and the promotion of local economic development are obvious facts to all.As the largest hydropower station in Ecuador's history, it is a landmark project made possible by China-Ecuador practical cooperation, playing an important role in helping Ecuador's transformation from an electricity importer to an electricity exporter, while seeing an increase in foreign exchange earnings rise.Since the project was put into commercial operation in 2016, it has generated about 42 billion kWh of electricity so far, meeting over a quarter of Ecuador's national electricity demand. The Power Construction Corp of China (PowerChina), the project developer, told the Global Times on Thursday.In terms of the so-called debt issues that Western media has claimed, the engineering, procurement, and construction contract value stood at $1.98 billion, with most of the financing provided by the Export-Import Bank of China, a big relief to a country with prevailing financial difficulties.So far, the owner's income from power generation has far exceeded the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract cost for the project's construction, PowerChina said.Economically and environmentally, the commissioning and power generation of the CCS hydropower station has greatly improved Ecuador's power supply capacity, optimized the country's energy matrix, saved oil and gas resources, effectively reduced carbon emissions, and transformed Ecuador from an electricity importer to an electricity exporter in one fell swoop, PowerChina said.However, by choosing to overlook the significance of the project to the regional economy and people's livelihoods, the report selectively sidestepped these achievements and intentionally nitpicked the project, experts said.The report forcibly pieced together issues that were not directly related, such as the relationship between the construction of the power station, the initial design, and the subsequent river erosion, giving the false impression that it is entirely the fault of Chinese companies, the Chinese Embassy further noted.The power station is just one of many targets for Western smears against the BRI.The Angolan Kilamba Kiaxi-Belas Municipal Planning Project, a large social housing project outside the capital of Luanda, Angola, was also targeted in the media report.Initiated jointly by the country's government and China's CITIC Construction in 2008, the project came to light to meet the needs of Angola's post-war reconstruction and people's livelihoods, according to a statement that CITIC Group sent to the Global Times on Tuesday.The project includes the construction of a total of 20,002 housing units and the support of municipal works, with a resident population of 120,000.Since its completion in 2012, the current handover and occupancy rates are at 100 percent, which has greatly alleviated the urgent housing needs of the Angolan people, the company said. As a demonstrable and livable new city built in a desert, the project has won the highest praise from both governments of China and Angola.However, the recent report by The Wall Street Journal claimed that it has ""cracked walls, moldy ceilings, and poor construction,"" in one of its many attempts at discrediting BRI projects.In response to the allegation, CITIC Group said in a statement to the Global Times that the project does not have any construction problems.""On the contrary, because of the excellent design and construction of the project and the sound municipal service system, it was sold out within a relatively short period of time after completion and handover, which was affirmed by the Angolan people,"" the company said.So-called ""poor construction quality"" related problems are due to the fact that after some residents moved in, to meet the needs of individualized living, their houses were substantially renovated, with components such as floors, wall coatings, water, and electricity pipelines installed in kitchens and bathrooms, CITIC Group noted.Due to substandard workmanship, these renovations destroyed the original water and electricity pipelines and subverted waterproof measures, resulting in water leakage in some houses.""Even though, this ratio of damages was not high, and was rare,"" the company said. At the request of the owner, CITIC Group also actively assisted in remedying the situation, and repairs have since been completed.Infrastructure, as the backbone of the Belt and Road construction projects, has always been a key focus of Chinese companies, with factors such as quality, cost, and the consideration of the impact of construction having repeatedly been demonstrated in the preliminary level of every project before being approved, experts said.""From a national point of view, we closely monitor corresponding Chinese companies' participation in the BRI construction for quality control,"" Song Wei, a professor at the School of International Relations and Diplomacy, the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Special attention has also been paid to the economic benefits that the project is likely to generate, including the recruitment of all staff in engineering construction and the operation of the projects, so as to improve the livelihoods of the local people and promote the sustainable development of the local economy, Song Wei said.The new round of criticism and hype by foreign media against Chinese infrastructure projects in the 10th year of the BRI is another reflection of the fact that the decade-long cooperation has achieved positive results, with many iconic projects having been completed, which have made the US-led West fear losing their power of influence over other regions, experts said.To date, 151 countries and 32 international organizations have signed more than 200 cooperation documents on the joint construction of the BRI, official data showed. More countries are expected to follow suit in the future.Meanwhile, to beef up the quality standard of infrastructure projects, China has actively been promoting cooperation in national standards for the joint construction of the Belt and Road. More than one-third of the key infrastructure projects under construction in countries and regions along the Belt and Road have adopted China's high standards, according to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ""At the current juncture, the world, especially developing countries, has been deeply impacted by the global pandemic and urgently needs to recover, a recovery in which the BRI cooperation can further play a part as it leads a high-quality development path for global cooperation,"" Song Wei said.

Australian exports to China stood at $142.09 billion, down 13.1 percent.Better bilateral relations will set a very positive tone for economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, especially for Australia, where inflation shot to a 33-year high in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the cost of travel and electricity jumped. The Australian business community has been eagerly awaiting a boost in ties. ""We welcome any move that strengthens economic and cultural ties between the two nations, and we're hopeful of further dialogue and engagement,"" the Treasury Wine Estate's CEO Tim Ford told the Global Times in December after the two countries' foreign ministers met in Beijing.Some Chinese firms have also ""tested the waters"" since the beginning of 2023, as industry insiders told the Global Times that the first shipment of about 72,000 tons of Australian coking coal is expected to arrive at Zhanjiang Port, South China's Guangdong Province on February 8.Meanwhile, domestic coal industry insiders remain cautious, noting that the shipment from Australia is small, and it will take time for more Chinese companies to regain confidence in the Australian side.When asked whether China will soon lift the ""restrictions"" on wider Australian exports such as cotton, rock lobster, wine and barley, Yang said that the main body of China-Australia trade is enterprises. ""Enterprises of the two countries make independent business decisions based on demand and market conditions, and some inspection and quarantine measures adopted by China strictly abide by Chinese laws and regulations and WTO rules,"" Yang said.With China's optimized pandemic responses, bilateral trade will recover and even rebound, and this trend will become even stronger within three years, Chen said.In addition to high expectations for rising trade flows in bulk commodities like iron ore and coal, other areas of bilateral cooperation such as green energy and digital transformation can be new fields to tap into, Chen said.Both China and Australia are important countries in the Asia-Pacific region. A sound and steady development of bilateral relationship serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and contributes to the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and the world, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a press conference in Beijing on Thursday.

However, whether a lunar tide effect existed in the plasma-dominated regions had not been explored yet.Xiao Chao, the paper's co-first author, a researcher at Shandong University, said they made the new findings by analysing data from more than 10 satellites over the past four decades.They found that the lunar tide-induced signal in the Earth's plasmasphere possesses distinct diurnal and monthly periodicities, which are different from the semidiurnal and semimonthly variations dominant in the previously observed lunar tide effects in other regions.The new findings expand our understanding of Earth-Moon interactions in a direction that had not been previously considered, said Xiao.They also provide important clues for future investigations in broader regions and two-body celestial systems within and beyond the solar system.Xinhua                         "

The results showed that the post-holiday labor return rate hit more than 80 percent. However, some firms still face labor shortages which are preparing to expand their capacity.South China's Guangdong Province, another economic powerhouse, have ramped up efforts to lure migrant workers from other provinces. On the eve of the Spring Festival, 10 key firms and human resource organizations in Zhongshan city rode a cross-provincial recruitment bus to Hezhou, Guigang and other places in neighboring Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to hire workers.According to the 2023 Guangdong Government Work Report delivered on January 12, Guangdong's GDP reached 12.8 trillion yuan ($1.90 trillion) in 2022, a year-on-year increase of 2 percent, ranking first in China for 34 consecutive years.While some provinces are competing for labor, others - particularly in the underdeveloped middle and western regions - are trying to convince workers to stay at home.""Our company is recruiting inspectors and engineers, and each category needs 500-1,000 workers,"" a staff member surnamed Li from a state-owned company based in Northwest China's Gansu Province told the Global Times on Monday.Li said that frontline workers are the highest paid, with salaries of more than 10,000 yuan ($1,485) per month, while ordinary employees get about 5,000 yuan.The busy recruitment market reflects the resolve of local governments and enterprises in reviving the economy, experts said.Domestic supply and industry chains are in a critical period of recovery after China optimized COVID-19 response at the end of 2022, and labor demand has increased as companies prepare for a busy year ahead, according to Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the Economic Policy Commission at the China Association of Policy Science.People who work outside their home provinces face high costs and family separations.

Discussing its ""impressive yet imperfect performance"", some industry players also raised a question: How far are we from a ChatGPT designed by a Chinese company?On January 30, roughly three months after its official launch, Chinese tech giant Baidu was reportedly to be planning the launch of an AI chatbot service similar to ChatGPT, which may be unveiled in March, with the initial version having been integrated into its search service, and it will allow users to receive conversational search results.Baidu CEO Robin Li hailed the project as ""leading the generational reform in the search experience,"" saying internally that relevant technology has reached a critical point and that Baidu has a great opportunity in it, according to a report from the domestic news site chinastarmarket.com.""It's ambitious and exciting. But we believe it's achievable because the technology has reached a critical point. Technologies like ChatGPT service will get popular, but how to apply it to search scenarios is more difficult to explore than the technology itself. How can we make this happen, so that hundreds of millions of people benefit from it every day, and their efficiency is significantly improved? We have a great opportunity in this regard,"" Li said in the report.""Baidu does have plans for (making) such a tool, and research was accelerated at the end of 2022,"" several people close to the matter told the Global Times, declining to disclose further details.Baidu did not reply to an interview request from the Global Times.So, what is ChatGPT? ""I am ChatGPT, an AI language model developed by OpenAI. I can answer questions on various topics and perform various language tasks such as text generation, summarization and translation,"" the chatbot told the Global Times while being asked to introduce itself.The chatbot goes beyond traditional ones that are focused on personal communication and provides a range of responses including code, essays, and scientific reports, and sometimes, proves to outperform human beings.Baidu, a Chinese internet search leader in China, has its tech strength to do the ""cash-burning"", Liu Dingding, a veteran internet industry watcher, told the Global Times on Sunday.Although in terms of semantic understanding and core presentation ability, it may not necessarily be better than the US one, after the first step of the official launch, as the number of users and data collected increase and computing power strengthens, its understanding will improve, and it will definitely become an indispensable tool in answering content creation questions, Liu said.Apart from Baidu, industry watchers told the Global Times that other Chinese firms have also made forays into the sector and made some early explorations.""Our team is currently exploring using chatbots to create short videos and other similar content, and enable creators to rev up production efficiency in content creation,"" a staffer at a domestic short-video company, told the Global Times.The individual noted that though user experience of ChatGPT is ""breath-taking"" compared with its predecessors, disadvantages are also obvious - for instance, ChatGPT is prone to giving biased, incorrect answers, or outdated ones since its training data is unfiltered and only goes up to 2021.""We are trying to avoid that for our training,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.Other chatbots in China are also used in more professional tasks, such as programming, essay writing or game development.Chinese tech giants such as Bytedance, Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba, and SenseTime all have strong AI capabilities, as well as the accumulation of relevant data needed to develop a model, Liu said. However, regarding to basic AI algorithm structures and the models, Chinese enterprises lag behind by about two years, according to some industry insiders.ChatGPT's question-and-answer logic and performance as an AI are very good, which proves that AI has become a useful tool. The difference from the previous technology is that ChatGPT is a large model, which has a stronger understanding of contextual semantics than other AI algorithms, and the data accumulation speed is faster than its competitors, with growth and usability, Pan Helin, joint director of the Research Center for Digital Economics and Financial Innovation affiliated with Zhejiang University's International Business School, told the Global Times on Sunday.But so far, ""we have not seen a relatively strong AI algorithm model in China at this stage"", Pan said. It may be technically capable, but by combining the three levels of algorithm, computing power, and data, there are currently no domestic companies that can launch ChatGPT-equivalent algorithms, Pan said.A report released by UBS on Wednesday showed that ChatGPT is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, two months after its launch, becoming the fastest-growing consumer app.This is an unprecedented rate of expansion - TikTok took about 9 months to reach 100 million users after its launch, while Meta's Instagram took about 2.5 years. ""I had very mixed feelings after I tried ChatGPT - I am excited to see that artificial intelligence can develop to this point, but also concerned whether Chinese companies can rapidly catch up, though we can anticipate that,"" Liu said.In essence, there exists a competition of AI capabilities between China and the US - to compete with such a strong competitor, China has to go ahead and overcome all challenges it faces, from management ideas, computing power, algorithms, and data circulation, to capital investment needed to achieve the set goal, Pan said.

Besides oil, the firm has a lot of subsidiaries. We will do our best to introduce Hong Kong's advantages, and we encourage them to come to Hong Kong for different types of involvement, including getting listed here,"" Lee said after arriving in Riyadh, according to HKT.It's not the first time that the Hong Kong market is being considered for Aramco's share sale. The city might stand out this time as Hong Kong is more appealing in terms of listing rules and procedures than London or New York, where a share offering could mean higher costs, Raymond Deng, investment strategist at DBS Bank, told the Global Times on Monday.After raising $29.4 billion in a historic first listing at home exchange in December 2019,  Aramco has reportedly been mulling plans to list more shares through a secondary listing, with London, New York, Singapore and Hong Kong among the options being reviewed.Still, whether the secondary listing could land in Hong Kong would largely be contingent on the local market capacity to host a listing as colossal as Aramco's, Deng said, estimating that the secondary listing would be ideally scheduled during the second half of the year.If Hong Kong succeeds in getting Aramco to list, it would be a real shot in the arm for HKEX, Deng noted, citing depository and issue fees from derivatives to be launched alongside IPOs and other service commissions that make up a big part of HKEX's revenues.

The port's operation has been suspended.Iskenderun is not far away from the Hunutlu Thermal Power Plant, the largest China-invested coal-fired power plant in Turkey with two units of 660-megawatt power generation equipment and direct investment of $1.7 billion. The power plant became fully operational in October last year after construction started in September 2019.China Energy Engineering Corp (Energy China), the Hunutlu Thermal Power Plant's designer, sent a statement to the Global Times on Tuesday stating that the project, thanks to the reliable quality of Made in China equipment, was undamaged during and after the giant earthquake.The power plant continues to generate power, which offered a secured guarantee to the aid work in the quake-stricken area, even as two nearby power plants were knocked offline by the quake and tightened power supply in the region, Energy China said in the statement. The power plant is located near the epicenter of the earthquake and the living quarters for engineers were not damaged by the quake.Zhang Guolei, a manager at the site, was among the first of the Chinese engineers to check the power plant's safety amid heavy rain before dawn of Monday, shortly after the initial wave of the earthquake began to cease.""Fortunately, the structure of the plant remained sound. The equipment was working, and everything was safe and stable,"" the statement said.The project's team also provided shelters to relatives of Turkish employees, whose houses were damaged in the quake.Energy China's workers' union in Beijing has reached out the project site over the delivery of charity and aid goods for local employees and residents based on the local situation.The direct impact of the earthquake for some Chinese companies with projects or branch offices situated in the central and western part of Turkey has so far been limited, the Global Times learned on Tuesday afternoon.One branch company of PowerChina based in Istanbul, which is situated relatively far away from the center of the earthquake, said that they did not feel the earthquake and everything was normal so far.Several employees of another Chinese branch company based in Aksaray in central Turkey said that they felt the heavy tremors on the ground but there were no reports of casualties or houses collapsing in the place where the project is located.China announced on Tuesday 40 million yuan ($5.8 million) of emergency assistance to Turkey and the dispatch of a rescue and medical team. It will also provide Syria with emergency aid, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency.Some Chinese companies also offered help. The Spacety Co, a company based in Central China's Hunan Province, immediately arranged for its Chaohu-1 satellite to conduct emergency imaging of the earthquake zone, the Global Times learned.

Meanwhile, the gross margin increased to 38 percent in 2022, also hitting a record high.However, citing an industry downturn and complex external uncertainties, the company said that revenue could drop between 10 percent and 12 percent in the first quarter of 2023. And even if the external environment remains stable, revenue is likely to drop by a low-teens percentage on a yearly basis. “Looking forward to 2023, in the first half of the year, the industry cycle is still at the bottom and the impact of external uncertainties is still complex,” SMIC said in the filing.China’s semiconductor industry and SMIC itself have become a top target in the US’ relentless technology crackdown campaign against China. The US put SMIC on its so-called Entity List as early as 2020, effectively banning supplies of critical chipmaking machines to the Chinese firm. In the latest move, Washington is pressuring allies such as Japan and the Netherlands to implement a ban on exports of advanced chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies. Yet, despite the US crackdown, SMIC has made strides in both revenue and technological advancement. For example, the company saw an annual growth rate of more than 30 percent for two consecutive years in 2021 and 2022, it said in the filing.On the technological front, the company said in October 2020 that it would soon produce 7-nanometer wafers for the Chinese market, which would be a major breakthrough. Then in 2022, some foreign media reports claimed that the company had produced a chip that shares qualities with those of a 7-nanometer chip, though the company has not responded to the claims.The company is also expanding its production capacity, with various new plants having entered or about to enter production. By the end of 2022, SMIC Shenzhen started production, SMIC Jingcheng began pilot production, and construction of SMIC Xiqing began, according to the company’s filing on Thursday. Meanwhile, the US’ ban on exports of chipmaking equipment may also delay some SMIC plants. Mass production at SMIC Jingcheng is scheduled to be postponed by one or two quarters due to equipment delays, the company said.                          "

The drills are expected to enhance the participants' interoperability against instabilities and threats in the Indian Ocean region and safeguard vital international sea lines of communication and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).A grand opening ceremony for the five-day AMAN-23 exercise was held on Friday morning at the Pakistan Navy Dockyard, in front of the PNS Taimur, a Type 054A/P guided missile frigate that China built for Pakistan. Honor guards raised the participating countries' national flags, while balloons and pigeons representing peace were released into the skies.Under the motto ""Together for Peace"", this is the eighth edition of the AMAN exercises since 2007. It is divided into two phases: harbor and sea. The harbor phase involves seminars, operational discussions, and professional demonstrations among other preparations, and the sea phase includes tactical maneuvers, anti-piracy, counterterrorism, search and rescue, live-fire shooting as well as air defense exercises, and will be followed by an international fleet review.AMAN is a message of peace and of being together with our friends and partners from all over the world, including China, Vice Admiral Ovais Ahmed Bilgrami, Commander of the Pakistan Fleet, told the Global Times on the sidelines at the opening ceremony.""We want to build mutual capacities and mutual understandings so that we can all work together to ensure peace and security at sea,"" he said.""China has been our greatest friend. There's no doubt that whatever the future holds for us at sea, it would not be possible without China. The China and Pakistan friendship is going to prosper further at sea,"" said Commodore Sohail Ahmed Azmie, Commander of the Auxiliary and Mine Squadron of the Pakistan Navy.He told the Global Times at the event that the Pakistan Navy has been operating with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, and in the future, this trend is going to be enhanced.The participating vessel from China is the Nanning, a Type 052D guided missile destroyer that is part of the PLA Navy's 43rd escort task force to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, which set out from a naval port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province on January 10.It is the Nanning's first time participating in such a mission. The domestically developed warship has received an upgraded propulsion system among many other modifications, the PLA Navy said in a press release at the time.The Nanning arrived at Karachi on Thursday, and was met with a warm welcome from the host country.Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, Chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview prior to the exercise that there are a number of non-traditional threats that prevail in the wider Indian Ocean region such as terrorism, piracy, drug smuggling, and arms trafficking. The vastness of the oceans makes the maritime arena an attractive avenue for illegal activities, and no country has the capability to singlehandedly counter these challenges. The exercise is conducted with the aim of developing synergy between participating naval units to tackle maritime security challenges by enhancing interoperability between regional and extra-regional navies at different levels of technological prowess, he said.As a maritime nation, Pakistan has substantial stakes in keeping its seas safe and secure, including the operationalization of the CPEC project and the global energy highway, the Global Times learned at the exercise.The first edition of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference (PIMEC) was also launched on Friday in Karachi, concurrently with the AMAM-23 exercise. Initiated by the Pakistan Navy, PIMEC aims to showcase the potential of Pakistan's maritime sector and draw attention to the contribution that the maritime industry can make to the development of the blue economy.

Both sides described the meeting as an ""important step"" in bringing China-Australia economic and trade relations back onto the right track and agreed to maintain communication. At the meeting, Wang invited Farrell to visit China at ""an appropriate time"" and Farrell confirmed he will visit China ""in the near future.""The highly anticipated meeting and the upcoming visit by the Australian trade minister to China have boosted expectations for improving economic and trade ties between the two countries after years of tension. However, many foreign media reports and the Australian side's statement on the meeting notably focus primarily on Canberra's call for resumption of ""unimpeded trade."" Legitimate concerns raised by China about Australia's treatment of Chinese companies were largely left out.During the virtual meeting, Wang told Farrell that China pays close attention to Australia's tightening of security reviews on Chinese companies investing and operating in Australia and hopes that Australia will properly handle relevant cases and provide Chinese companies with a fair, open and non-discriminatory business environment. Wang also pointed out that China-Australia economic and trade ties face an important window and the two sides should work together to inject more positive factors into economic and trade cooperation. Yet, Australia's official response to the meeting did not mention these remarks by the Chinese commerce minister. It did, however, mention the ""unimpeded"" and ""full"" resumption of trade twice, as if the Chinese side is solely responsible for restoring bilateral trade ties to normal. It is quite normal for officials to put out statements that are worded in their favor. It is also true that one meeting cannot realistically address all the issues between the two countries. Yet, for the sake of improving bilateral ties, it is necessary to remind the Australian side that to normalize bilateral economic and trade relations, the two sides must meet halfway and address each other's legitimate concerns.Despite recent signs of improvement, Canberra cannot turn a blind eye to a slew of hostile moves it has taken against Chinese companies and investments over the years. Canberra has banned Chinese telecommunications firms Huawei and ZTE from providing 5G technology for its wireless networks. It has also unilaterally revoked two cooperation documents between China and the Australian state of Victoria over the Belt and Road Initiative and launched a review into a Chinese firm's lease for the port of Darwin, among other moves. Australia's notorious Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has also implemented new strict rules on foreign investment and blocked a number of major Chinese investment deals, according to the Australian media.  Most recently, in November 2022, even as Canberra was actively seeking to improve ties with China, Australia vowed to be ""more assertive"" in scrutinizing foreign investments in key materials for electric cars and clean energy, Bloomberg reported, noting that it was ""a potential warning to China."" Bloomberg further linked Australia's pledge to the US' push to limit China's access to key supply chains and Canada's earlier move to order three Chinese firms to divest their interests in a trio of lithium miners. Whether Australia will follow through with that pledge remains to be seen, as a venture headed by Chinese firm Tianqi Lithium in January made a bid to buy Australian lithium developer Essential Metals, which requires approval from the FIRB, Reuters said.As bilateral relations are showing improving signs, many Chinese businesses are also undoubtedly exploring opportunities in Australia. Given the highly complementary nature of the two economies, the opportunities are abundant. The question is whether Canberra is ready to treat Chinese companies and investments fairly. Australian officials' eagerness to improve economic and trade ties with China has been clear and has received a positive response from China. But to resume ""full"" and ""unimpeded"" trade, as Australian officials have called for, Canberra must first take concrete actions to address China's legitimate concerns and provide Chinese companies with a fair, non-discriminatory business environment. In this regard, Canberra shouldn't think that it can get away with just paying lip service.                          "

The initial batch of tours under a pilot program for group tours including flight and hotel services was to 20 destination countries. The clamor in other tourism sub-sectors has certainly been a morale boost for the cruise business and market entrants including the Royal Caribbean who had been calling for an earlier resumption of cross-border cruise services, which by definition include port calls to at least one foreign port.""Now we can almost see the prospect of resumption of this industry slowing emerging on the horizon,"" Liu told the Global Times. With the State Council, China's cabinet, having issued a policy calling for a piloted resumption of the cruise market, Liu revealed that the industry and local government authorities are exchanging views regularly with many meetings to discuss details regarding the earliest possible reopening of the international cruise business. ""The trend of restarting the sector is already very clear. The move to ease relevant policy curbs needs to be fast as the industry can't afford any more delays, as the Northeast Asian market is already lagging by two years compared with the US and the Europe markets,"" Liu said.According to the industry portal Cruise Industry News, as of October 2022, some 93 percent of the global cruise fleet was back in service.As the cruise business has an exceedingly long upstream and downstream supplier industrial chain, it will still take months once the industry gets a policy nod before the first cruise ship can set sail, Liu said, predicting that the industry could be reopened toward the end of this year or in 2024.While many big international cruise companies left China in the last three years when outbound cruise operations were suspended, there were also companies that took a different approach.Brendan Tansey, managing director of Viking Cruises China, told the Global Times that throughout 2022, the company shifted its focus to domestic ocean cruise products, resulting in the launch of the company's China Coastal Cultural Cruises - a domestic luxury ocean cruise product - on October 1, 2021. It is the only premium ocean cruise still operational in the Chinese market to date. Over 75 successful cruises have so far been completed by the company's ship , a ship under a joint venture between Viking Cruises and China Merchants Shekou.Tansey said the global cruise industry in most markets around the world has recovered, and has seen a very encouraging comeback with pent-up travel demand driving up passenger numbers. For Viking Cruises, bookings for both river and ocean itineraries for English-speaking markets outside of China have returned to pre-pandemic levels.""We are receiving more inquiries about our cruises, and passenger numbers for our existing domestic ocean product are slowly picking up. But we can see that guests are really keen on outbound itineraries based on the inquiries we receive,"" Tansey said, noting the company's confidence in the Chinese cruise market's huge growth potential.Tansey said Viking believes Chinese consumers are interested in cruise travel, but whether the growth falls on domestic or outbound cruises depends to a large extent on issues including whether the local policy is conducive to actual operations.""We will continue to operate our domestic ocean cruises, while making sure we remain flexible to pivot to outbound itineraries if demand and travel policies both in China and at the target destinations present ripe opportunities,"" Tansey said.Industry experts said cruise tourism is also subject to certain geopolitics risks. In one instance in 2017, when China and South Korea clashed over the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, over 3,400 Chinese tour travelers refused to disembark from their cruise ship at South Korea's Jeju Island, grabbing media attention.  Developing the cruise industry also brings a series of benefits for China to improve the quality of its shipbuilding industry, help related suppliers upgrade their products, and further improve China's business environment, they noted.The promising Chinese market has shown its potential to industry players in the decade prior to the pandemic, it's now high time to allow the market to return back to its Golden Age course, the Royal Caribbean's Liu said.According to a report by the China Cruise & Yacht Industry Association and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, the cruise ship industry could contribute a total of 550 billion yuan ($81.05 billion) in economic output to the Chinese economy by 2035.

For example, China Southern Airlines said on Monday that it will continue to increase its international capacity, and it will resume and open 48 round-trip routes to 12 foreign countries.The resumption of Chinese outbound tourism has boosted growth prospects in the countries included in the pilot program, as Chinese tourists provide the majority of their international visitors and tourism revenue. Malaysia for example could see a 1 percentage point boost in GDP growth from the effect of stronger tourism activity due to the resumption of China's outbound travel, according to UOB Global Economics & Market Research.Countries that have not been included in the pilot programs are actively preparing. Japan, which initially took anti-epidemic measures targeting arrivals from China, was not included in the pilot program. The head of the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO)'s office in Shanghai expressed regret that Japan was not included, but the JNTO held an event in Beijing to attract Chinese tourists. A Chinese manager at a travel agency in Tokyo surnamed Shang said that the Japanese industry is paying close attention to potential changes in policies. ""Although Japan is not in the pilot program for outbound group tours this time, as long as China allows outbound tours, we are still confident and hopeful,"" Shang told the Global Times on Tuesday.

As China's economy is on track for a recovery this year, initially evidenced by a partial revival in the consumer market, the overall trajectory will likely follow a low to high path, Tan said. In a sign of room for improvement, the Caixin manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), which focuses on private smaller businesses, edged up to 49.2 in January from 49 in December, but still in contraction territory. By comparison, the official PMI was back in expansion territory in January, rising to 50.1 from 47 in December. Anticipating a rosier outlook for the Chinese economy, Nomura economists led by Lu Ting said in a note sent to the Global Times earlier that ""we are raising (China's) 2023 annual GDP growth forecast to 5.3 percent from 4.8 percent.""They cited China's sequential GDP growth in the fourth quarter of last year, which beat market expectations, and the country's reopening efforts over the past month.China posted a 2.9 percent GDP expansion year-on-year in the fourth quarter, official data showed.Still, any one-sided swings in forex reserves would be less likely, Tan noted.The pent-up demand for outbound travel that's being unleashed after the country resumed outbound group tours to a selection of countries and regions could somewhat dent the country's forex reserves, she said.In addition, uncertainty confronting export orders amid woes over a global economic slowdown might have an impact on forex sales, putting downward pressure on forex reserves, the economist said, urging greater support for the real economy.

Some German companies face potential heavy losses, German media outlets said.If Dutch company ASML's sales in China fall due to the US export ban, German suppliers for ASML - Zeiss and Trumpf - would also suffer losses. Infineon, Germany's largest semiconductor manufacturer, whose businesses in China recently achieved 38 percent of its total sales - will also potentially be affected by US restrictions, German newspaper Junge Welt reported on Monday.As reported by the German media, the indirect impact of the US semiconductor ban is spreading to more European countries that have mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation with China. If Europe cannot resist the lobbying and pressure of the US, the semiconductor industry in European countries will probably suffer.After coercing the Netherlands to reach an agreement that reportedly bars some shipments of the country's most high-tech machinery to China, the US is stepping up its pressure on other European countries. This is a major challenge currently facing the EU. European countries should resist the US and actively protect the interests of their own companies.Europe knows well that the US' attempt to coerce Europe to suppress China in the semiconductor field is entirely a geopolitical calculation. It is based on the interests of the US and will harm the interests of European countries. In another report on Monday, Junge Welt said that the US' semiconductor restrictions will bring serious losses for businesses. The global economy is facing new crises caused by Washington's ""Silicon Iron Curtain.""Expanding cooperation with China in the semiconductor field, rather than following the US' decoupling approach, would be beneficial for the European economy. Two years ago, China's semiconductor industry caught up with Europe, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the global market, and it could reach 17 percent next year, media reported citing the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). According to industry forecasts, by 2027, the market size of China's semiconductor sector is expected to reach $445.3 billion, which would offer a great opportunity for EU businesses amid US ""decoupling.""Against the background of the US' intensifying tech war against China and the uncertain prospects of globalization, the EU's economic and trade cooperation policy with China may face adjustments. It is understandable that the stance of different EU members may vary widely on specific issues. However, European countries are generally unwilling to pay the huge costs of ""decoupling"" from China because it harms their interests. On the US' chip export restrictions, Europe should increase coordination and have a stronger collective voice. The outlook for the semiconductor sector in European countries depends on the current policy direction in Europe. China will continue to expand mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries in the semiconductor field, so if European policymakers can clearly realize the divergence of interests between the semiconductor industry and the US and firmly maintain policy independence, European semiconductor companies will benefit from China's progress in the sector.

The report said some research institutions estimated that annual consumption by visitors to Japan will reach 3.1 trillion yen ($23.4 billion), about 60 percent of the 2019 level, but the estimation is based on the premise that tourist arrivals from the Chinese mainland will recover after the summer, otherwise, this will not be achieved.It is understandable to see Japanese tourism's high expectation for the return of Chinese visitors. Frankly speaking, Japan's tourism sector is unable to get a ""bona fide"" rebound without Chinese travelers. The country saw 31.9 million inbound tourists in 2019, among which visitors from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong scored an overwhelming top share of about 11.89 million, or 37 percent of the total, the Japan Times reported, citing data from the Japan National Tourism Organization. If Japan cannot attract Chinese tourists, there will be no country that can make up the gap left by this group. A big boost from the recovery of inbound tourism to pre-pandemic levels will turn out to be just empty talk without the return of Chinese travelers.Before the pandemic, Japan's tourism industry was booming. Data from Japan External Trade Organization JETRO showed that travel and tourism sector contributed $359 billion to Japan's GDP in 2019, making it the world's third-largest market in this sector after the US and China. Some analysts said the key to reviving the Japanese economy will depend on whether the government can make the tourism industry resilient and sustainable, but the Japanese government has obviously failed to satisfy people's hope for tourism recovery.Japan has tightened border controls for COVID-19 by requiring tests for all visitors from the Chinese mainland. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno was quoted as saying last week that Japan will maintain for the time being its COVID-19 border control rules, although tourism related practitioners are strongly dissatisfied.China on Monday resumed overseas group tours for Chinese citizens to 20 countries including Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia, with Japan excluded from the list. The result is in line with expectations. Some Southeast Asian countries like Thailand have become the first destinations for many Chinese tourists as the country resumed overseas group tours. Outbound tourism to Southeast Asia has heated up almost immediately since China optimized COVID-19 management measures at the end of last year. Why? It's partly because those countries have a friendly attitude toward Chinese tourists. ""Thailand is every Chinese traveler's dream destination, and the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has launched the 'Two Lands, One Heart' travel promotion to welcome them,"" Nation Thailand reported. Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri was quoted as saying on Monday that TAT is planning to increase the frequency of flights to attract Chinese visitors. It is clear that Thailand hopes that the return of Chinese tourists can offer a boost for its economy in 2023.No matter how Japanese officials justify the work on border controls, they cannot deny that Japan has lost completely in the first round of competition to attract Chinese tourists, and has missed the economic growth opportunities brought by tourism recovery. Comparing Japan with Thailand's enthusiasm toward Chinese tourists, Tokyo's political prejudice, which has hurt the recovery of the economy, seem naive and ignorant. Southeast Asia's enthusiasm for Chinese travelers should arouse reflection in Japan.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn                         "
Economy,By Hu Weijia  |  2023/2/6 22:59:06,India needs more than import duty exemptions to become global vehicle testing hub ,"To encourage foreign automakers to test their vehicles in India, import duty will be removed for automobiles brought in for testing at the country's vehicle testing agencies such as International Center for Automotive Technology (iCAT), the Economic Times reported on Monday. The exemption of import duties is undoubtedly conducive to the development of India's automobile manufacturing industry and should therefore win applause from all directions, but it should be pointed out that the country may still has a long way to go to become a ""global testing hub.""",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-06/09062591-943f-4398-93f7-26a208cb99d7.jpeg," To encourage foreign automakers to test their vehicles in India, import duty will be removed for automobiles brought in for testing at the country's vehicle testing agencies such as International Center for Automotive Technology (iCAT), the Economic Times reported on Monday. The exemption of import duties is undoubtedly conducive to the development of India's automobile manufacturing industry and should therefore win applause from all directions, but it should be pointed out that the country may still has a long way to go to become a ""global testing hub.""The exemption will take effect from April 1. Currently, foreign automakers have to pay an import duty of 252 percent on the vehicles they bring into the country for testing. Mahendra Nath Pandey, minister of heavy industries, was quoted by the Business Standard as saying that the custom duty is too high to maintain Indian test agencies' competitiveness and ""with zero custom duty India will become a global testing hub."" Although the tariff exemption is a step in the right direction, it will be a little too optimistic to assume that India can become a global testing hub without a mature auto manufacturing sector and a complete industrial chain as the basis for development.The Indian government has four vehicle testing centers including iCAT. Although Indian agencies has key facilities such as vehicle crash test system, sled test system, pedestrian protection system, and airbag deployment system, the country is not yet an attractive destination for testing and certification of vehicles. Currently, global automakers mostly test their vehicles in the US, Japan, South Korea and China. The growth in automotive testing market is mainly driven by the factors such as growing automobile production. The exemption of import duties is simply not enough to make India a global testing hub. If India wants to realize its ambitions in the auto industry, more efforts should be made to inject new momentum into the economy.In the January-November period 2022, 4.13 million vehicles - including passenger and commercial - were sold in the country, the Times of India reported, citing data from the Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers. India has reportedly become the world's third-largest automotive market, beating Japan. It's understandable that the Indian government hopes to promote the development of automobile manufacturing industry and transform its huge market into a key driving force behind the progress of the country's automobile manufacturing industry. However, it won't be easy to achieve these goals.India imposes 100 percent import duty on fully imported cars with CIF (Cost, Insurance and Freight) value more than $40,000 and 60 percent on those costing less than the amount, said Press Trust of India in May 2022. Although many have called for reducing India's import tariffs on vehicles and auto parts, India has made little progress in this regard. Import tariffs have become an obstacle for multinational enterprises to open up the Indian market, damaging their enthusiasm to move their manufacturing plants to the country.The Indian automobile industry aims to be among the top two producers globally in every segment of vehicles over next 25 years, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said last year, according to the Times of India. However, it may be difficult for India to achieve its goal, if it relies simply on domestic manufacturers, without the support of foreign participants.Growing automobile production and a complete automobile industry chain will help India achieve its ambition of becoming a global testing hub. Things are moving in a good direction as India plans to remove import duty for automobiles brought in for testing to liberalize the market, but that's not enough. India should eliminate more tariffs and create a good business environment for foreign auto manufacturers, including Chinese enterprises. Such efforts will inject more vitality into the development of India's automobile industry                         "

As the trend forms for domestic residents to shift capital from deposits into investment channels and as real estate market's investment chances are decreasing, China's mutual fund market will witness plenty of opportunities over the next few years,"" he told the Global Times. However, Xi said that the speed of approval for global companies' entrance is a little slow in general since regulators scrapped foreign ownership restrictions in the industry in April 2022, although it has sped up a little in recent months as China moved to optimize coronavirus management measures.""It's a matter of two-way selection. On the one hand, Chinese regulators are focusing on introducing in overseas financial institutions with relatively strong strength and advanced management experience. On the other hand, overseas institutions also have concerns about whether they can issue funds smoothly in China, as the market is full of competition currently,"" Xi noted.Between November 2022 and January 2023 the regulator also approved Schroders, Fidelity International and Neuberger Berman Group to set up wholly owned new fund units.Apart from mutual funds firms, overseas companies are also mounting efforts to set up wholly owned companies in other financial sectors. On Friday, Standard Chartered said it had been granted approval by the CSRC to set up a mainland securities firm, according to a statement sent by the company to the Global Times that day.In the statement, the company said it was the first time that the CSRC has granted the establishment of a securities firm wholly owned by a foreign shareholder since ownership restrictions were scrapped three years ago.The securities firm, headquartered in Beijing, would have an initial capital injection of 1.05 billion yuan and would cover businesses including assets management, underwriting, securities brokerage and other activities. Zhang Xiaolei, President of Standard Chartered Bank (China), said that with the sustained and accelerated opening-up of China's capital market at a high level, the company wants to provide more financial solutions for domestic and foreign companies/institutions that come in or out from China for investment.Meanwhile, Munich-headquartered Allianz has also been approved by Chinese regulators to become the mainland's first wholly-owned foreign insurer.According to Xi, the gradually approval of setting financial institutions wholly owned by overseas capital is a natural result and requirement of China's financial opening up. ""Introducing overseas institutions can create benign competition for domestic companies. In particular, domestic companies can learn from multinational financial firms in terms of their business mechanism via business contact or cooperation,"" Xi said.He added that rising risk control abilities of domestic banks following setup of foreign banks in China is a good example of how domestic financial institutions can learn from overseas financial multinationals.On the other hand, overseas companies might clash with domestic partners in setting joint ventures, particularly in terms of internal management, and setting wholly-owned firms provides them more leeway to tap mainland markets, Xi said.

Over the past five years, the two countries reaped fruitful results in economic and trade cooperation as well as cultural and other exchanges. Recently, the two sides concluded the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations at the technical level. Global Times () reporter Liu Yang conducted an exclusive interview with Carlos Larrea (), Ambassador of Ecuador to China, in which the Ambassador shared his views on building up China-Ecuador good relations and close partnerships in Latin America, and he highly appreciated China's anti-COVID contribution to the international community in the past years. : What changes will be seen in foreign trade between China and Ecuador once the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) comes into force? : The Ecuador-China FTA was efficiently negotiated over a period of 10 months, following the roadmap laid out by President Xi Jinping and President Guillermo Lasso during Lasso’s official visit to Beijing a year ago. The agreement focuses on reducing tariffs to enable market access and includes several disciplines such as rules of origin, improvement of customs procedures and trade facilitation, protocols for sanitary and phytosanitary measures and reduction of technical barriers to trade.The signing of the Ecuador-China FTA will take place in the coming weeks, after the completion of the respective processes of formalization of the offers, translation, and legal review, on a date to be announced by both governments.The entry into force of this trade agreement will provide preferential access for 99 percent of Ecuador's current exports to China, mainly agricultural and agro-industrial products such as shrimp, bananas, roses and flowers, cocoa, coffee. It will also open the doors to exports of non-traditional products such as pitahaya, pineapple, mango, blueberries, quinoa, processed foods, fresh and canned fruits, and many other agricultural and agro-industrial products.This trade instrument will substantially improve the access of Ecuador's exportable supply to a market of more than 1.4 billion consumers, thus boosting the increase of exports, employment generation, growth, and investment attraction. Currently, joint trade between Ecuador and China exceeds $10 billion, which is strengthening and growing steadily. China is Ecuador's main non-oil trade partner. The deepening and expansion of trade, thanks to the trade agreement, will bring significant benefits for both countries.: On January 8 this year, China formally downgraded COVID-19 response. What are the benefits for Ecuador and the world? : Public opinion has welcomed the decision of the Chinese authorities to proceed with this progression. China's measures on cross-border travel from January 8 will strengthen confidence for large-scale investment, and major ports and industries in the world's second-largest economy will quickly return to normalcy.It will be a substantive contribution to the world economy, which has yet to overcome widespread inflation and the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, particularly the logistical, supply and energy problems. In the case of Ecuador, we are particularly pleased with the decision of the General Customs Administration to eliminate all control measures and nucleic acid detection for COVID-19 for imported foodstuffs. This will make it possible to regularize the flow of our foreign trade, the vast majority of which is made up of products that transit in cold chain, such as frozen white shrimp, which is highly prestigious among Chinese consumers and whose exports have increased exponentially thanks to its high quality, traceability, and safety.The Ecuadorian president has mentioned that the achievement of vaccination against COVID-19 is also - and to a large extent - a merit of world diplomacy in which China has played a decisive role, especially with developing countries. : What kind of cooperation has taken place between China and Ecuador to combat the pandemic? : China has been and is undoubtedly an important player in international cooperation to combat COVID-19. President Guillermo Lasso was one of the first leaders in the region to visit China since the outbreak of the pandemic, as a gesture of thanks to China for the country’s support to Ecuador in dealing with COVID-19. The two countries have shown solidarity in the face of the pandemic and supported each other in overcoming the difficulties.More than 50 percent of the doses of vaccines used in Ecuador came from China, which is a sign of effective implementation of the global community of health for all; there is also a decision to install a manufacturing plant of the biologicals in our country, thanks to an agreement with Sinovac. In 2018, Ecuador joined the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). What benefits have been brought to Ecuador under the initiative?: The slogan ""More Ecuador in the World and More of the World in Ecuador"" allows us to relate with the entire international community to obtain benefits for our country. China does not impose conditions on countries with which it cooperates, and this is the cornerstone of a relationship of great friendship, respect, and trust, as our president has appreciated.Bilateral relations are going through the best moment in their history. Our presidents have said so on several occasions. Ecuador and China uphold a vibrant bilateral agenda, framed in the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and in a political exchange at the highest level characterized by the deployment of presidential diplomacy.And, indeed, the new center of gravity of bilateral relations was configured based on the agreements reached by both presidents during the official visit to China on February 5, 2022, which brought together objectives of cardinal importance in these directions: cooperation in public health; the signing of the free trade agreement and the successful renegotiation of the bilateral debt, both in record time; the increase in bilateral and multilateral cooperation as well as cultural exchange and public diplomacy, among others, are a testimony to this affirmation.It is also the time to take this term of trade to a higher level, not only in volume but also in quality and sustainability, to reduce global asymmetries and support economic recovery.Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of balsa wood, which is needed for wind turbine blades in China. As the world transitions to renewable energy and a carbon-neutral economy, we are positioned to become an integral part of green energy supply chains. In fact, balsa wood is now one of Ecuador's most important export products to China, along with shrimp, oil and mining.We are ready to work with China on common goals such as mitigating the effects of the pandemic, economic recovery and promoting inclusive growth. From this perspective, Ecuador is a country of particular importance within the framework of the BRI.We welcome new forms of Chinese investment in hydrocarbons, mining, telecommunications, energy, civil infrastructure, logistics, green industries, Internet innovation and e-commerce. Today we have more than 100 relevant Chinese companies operating in Ecuador.Another relevant topic is that, since December 2019, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has become an important partner to deploy projects with a solid return, which raise economic growth, increase productivity, address ecological impacts, and provide inclusive access to infrastructure services.: On January 24, the 7th Summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was held in Argentina, during which the Chinese president also addressed via a video link. How do you assess the development and cooperation between China and Latin American countries in recent years?: Ecuador, in this forum, emphasized the need to strengthen dialogue with China, a country with which we maintain a dynamic cooperation mechanism and seeks to deepen political, economic, and cultural relations.I must refer, within the framework of CELAC, to the XV China-LAC Business Summit, which took place in Ecuador last December. This interregional meeting, which was created by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) in 2007, is a platform that has become a mechanism for dialogue and exchange for the economic and commercial sector of the CELAC countries with China. It was a successful exchange between investors, entrepreneurs, academics, media, and world experts on the most innovative issues related to investment and public-private partnerships.The summit welcomed new formats of international cooperation and investment in areas such as green industry and the digital economy. Above all, this regional event, which was the first to have a large Chinese delegation since the beginning of the pandemic, led by the president of CCPIT, marks a new stage of cooperation because of a close relationship between our region and China.

The Global Times () reporter Liu Yang recently conducted an exclusive interview with Chen Guoyou (), Chinese Ambassador to Ecuador, in which the ambassador shared his views on the China-Ecuador FTA and future cooperation, refuting foreign media outlet's smear against a local project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). : Coca Codo Sinclair Hydropower Station is the largest hydropower plant ever constructed in Ecuador as well as a landmark project in China-Ecuador bilateral cooperation. The project has an installed capacity of 1.5 million kilowatts with an EPC contract value of $1.98 billion, and was undertaken by the China Hydropower Group and mostly financed by the Export-Import Bank of China.To date, the cumulative power generation of the power plant has exceeded 40 billion kilowatt-hours, accounting for more than 30 percent of national power generation in Ecuador. It not only effectively eases electricity demand, optimizes the electricity structure of the country, and brings light to thousands of households across the country, but also helps the country transform from a power importing country to a power exporting country, and gain foreign exchange earnings.Regarding the partial cracks on the inner surface of the water distribution ring pipe of the hydropower project, the problem has been assessed by an international third-party independent testing agency TUV SUD, which concluded that it will not affect the operation and safety of the unit and that the plant is safe for its 50-year design lifespan. It should be noted that the report did not include interviews with all the parties involved, and the statements are not the full picture of what happened. In addition, the report pieced some issues that are not directly related together, such as the construction of the power plant, the preliminary design, and the problem of river erosion, giving people the illusion that it is the fault of the Chinese enterprises.: Ecuador is an important economic and trade partner of China in Latin America. Over the years, China and Ecuador have carried out cooperation following the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and a win-win situation, and achieved fruitful results.In recent years, driven by bilateral relations and Chinese investment and financing, Chinese enterprises have actively participated in the development of local infrastructure such as electricity, transportation, petroleum, and mining, and strategic areas such as oil and mining, as well as the construction of hospitals, housing, schools, and other infrastructure projects. The two countries have numerous landmark cooperation projects, mainly including the power station project cluster represented by the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydropower Station, The Ecuadorian 500kV Power Transmission and Transformation Project, the ECU911 Integrated Security Service, the infrastructure project cluster for post-earthquake reconstruction in 2016, the Mirador Copper Mining Project, and the oil block development project, and etc.As the promoters of pragmatic cooperation between the two countries and the practitioners of building a community with a shared future between China and Ecuador, the majority of Chinese enterprises in Ecuador have actively integrated into the local community, fulfilled their social responsibilities, and insisted on localized employment, creating thousands of jobs annually, bringing significant economic and social benefits to the country, and strongly contributing to the economic recovery and improvement of people's livelihoods.At the end of 2018, the Chinese and Ecuadorian governments signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the joint construction of the BRI, which has further deepened the pragmatic cooperation between the two sides in various fields. Looking to the future, we look forward to further deepening cooperation in traditional areas such as trade, investment and financing, as well as infrastructure, continuously expanding exchanges and cooperation in emerging areas such as 5G and new energy. We will develop new cooperation under the framework of high-quality construction of the BRI and overall cooperation between China and Latin America to achieve a higher level of mutual benefit and a win-win situation for both countries. The cooperation will open up broader prospects for economic and trade development between the two countries.: In February 2022, President Xi Jinping held a meeting with Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso, who was visiting China. After the meeting, the two countries issued a joint statement announcing the launch of FTA negotiations. With joint efforts, after more than 10 months of intensive consultations, China and Ecuador recently concluded the bilateral FTA negotiations at the technical level. At present, the two sides are stepping up the completion of their respective domestic procedures to announce the conclusion of the negotiations as soon as possible.It is believed that the signing of the FTA will definitely inject a strong impetus to upgrade the quality of bilateral trade, and is also conducive to promoting the two countries' market access, industrial interchange, and integration of interests, which will effectively benefit the two countries and the two peoples.: China and Ecuador are comprehensive strategic partners. Over the past 43 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, mutual political trust has been deepened with the increasing expansion of pragmatic cooperation and humanistic exchanges.It is especially worth mentioning that economic and trade cooperation has become the most active and fruitful area in the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. In recent years, the China-Ecuador economic and trade cooperation, which is based on complementary advantages and mutual benefits, has withstood the test of international changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, fully demonstrating its resilience and vitality.At present, China has become the second largest trading partner and the largest non-oil product trading partner of Ecuador. Ecuador is the 8th largest trading partner of China in Latin America, with bilateral trade continuously progressing in a balanced and sustainable direction. According to Chinese statistics, in 2022, bilateral trade between China and Ecuador reached $13.08 billion, up 19.7 percent year-on-year, of which Ecuador's exports to China amounted to $6.8 billion, up 24.6 percent year-on-year. The two countries have also been cooperating on major projects driven by Chinese investment and financing.Since President Lasso took office in May 2021, he has attached great importance to the development of relations with China, and the two sides have maintained close communication and reached many important agreements on deepening practical cooperation in trade, investment, and other fields.Bilateral economic and trade cooperation between China and Ecuador has ushered in new development opportunities, and we are confident about the prospects of bilateral cooperation.

Many anticipate an export boom from China's expected increase in demand for commodities.China's reopening could potentially help Canada avoid a recession, while Australia could see a boost of 0.4 percentage points to its GDP, and many Latin American economies are expecting a boom.Chairing a meeting to solicit opinions on the government work report to the NPC, Premier Li Keqiang urged efforts to implement a package of economic stabilization measures and try to accelerate economic recovery, the Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.More growth-boosting policies could be rolled out by the government, said Dong Dengxin, director of the Finance and Securities Institute of the Wuhan University of Science and Technology. ""China will swiftly become the locomotive of the world economy in the post-pandemic period,"" Dong told the Global Times on Tuesday.As the world's major manufacturing hub, China's demand for commodities ranging from oil, natural gas to iron ore will grow, a silver lining for many countries that rely on exports of the commodities, Dong said.""Commodities trade is booming, and more countries are counting on a vibrant Chinese economy to drive the growth of commodities in the world,"" he said. In Australia, for example, China's reopening could help lift the country's GDP by 0.4 percentage points over the next two years, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group said on Wednesday, citing a surge in Chinese students and visitors as well as rising natural gas exports, according to Bloomberg.Mike Henry, CEO of Australian mining giant BHP Group, said that China will be a stabilizing force for commodity demand this year, and the company will expand cooperation with Chinese partners, according to media reports. Australian officials are actively seeking to improve economic and trade ties.For Canada, which produces a lot of commodities, China's reopening could fuel demand for its exports, which could in turn help the country's economy ""avoid a recession as long as it does not also force up inflation and spur further interest-rate hikes,"" Reuters reported on Tuesday. Many countries in Latin America are expecting an economic boom, as China reopens from three years of anti-COVID restrictions, according to the Economist in January. The magazine noted that China's recovery is good news for commodity exporters like Chile and Brazil, which send a big chunk of their copper and soybean exports to China. However, some Western media are calling for ""caution"" about the impact of China's rapid economic recovery on already high global inflation. A Bloomberg article in January, for example, asserted that China was the ""next big threat to global inflation"".Such claims are exaggerating Chinese economy's impact on global inflation, which aim to provide cover for Western governments' mistakes that drove up inflation in the first place and their failure to bring it down, Chinese experts said. ""The worsening inflation was caused by the West themselves,"" with the US-led relentless tech restrictions on China that created disruptions to global supply chains as well as their irresponsible monetary policies, Dong said. The US and European economies are facing serious inflation, mostly because of their internal policies. China has kept inflation stable thanks to its prudent monetary policy over the past three years despite tremendous downward pressure, analysts noted, adding China will continue to maintain price stability in 2023. ""In 2022, the monetary and fiscal policy orientations of the US, the UK, Japan and other countries were mutually exclusive to varying degrees, resulting in a dilemma of coordination between monetary policy and fiscal policy, which will dampen market confidence and significantly amplify the uncertainty of inflation. A similar situation will most likely not appear in China,"" economists at ICBC International wrote in a note sent to the Global Times on Wednesday.                         "

She flew to Shanghai with her classmates to apply for a job at the Spring Airline.""The civil aviation industry has been in a downturn for the past three years, but now it's recovering, and my dream is in sight,"" Jin told the Global Times on Wednesday. Although the pandemic's impact on civil aviation is obvious, the training of airline personnel requires a long cycle, which means that the carriers need to hire staff now, market analysts said.For pilots, it takes four years from entering an aviation school to actually flying planes. ""Our recruitment is well underway for key roles such as pilots, engineers and trainee maintenance engineers,"" Xiao Fei, head assistant of the human resources department of Spring Airlines, told the Global Times on Wednesday.Hainan Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Spring Airlines and Xiamen Airlines all started recruiting in December, mainly for flight attendants, security guards and ground support personnel, reports said.Hainan Airlines said on February 3 that it will recruit cabin crew in Wuhan, Jinan, Changchun and Guiyang in the next two weeks. Xiamen Airlines told the Global Times on Wednesday that it has launched the 2023 flight attendant recruitment, and will soon start campus recruitment.The airline needs flight attendants (including attendants recruited from Taiwan island), maintenance workers, information technology staff and management trainees. Xiamen Airlines will employ more than 1,000 people, more than the previous two years' total. Market watchers said the rush to recruitment comes as the industry recovers, with a bid to address a shortage of cabin crew caused by the epidemic. Data from the information center under the Civil Aviation Administration of China show that the total number of flight attendants in China was 108,683 at the end of 2019, but shrank to 97,197 by the end of 2021.With many measures being taken to ease exit and entry restrictions, China's aviation industry is making a fast recovery, and many airlines have announced the resumption or increase of international and regional flights.Hainan Airlines plans to launch a new Guangzhou-Phuket route and resume the Beijing-Phuket route on February 24. As of January 23, it had resumed or launched 17 international and regional passenger routes including Beijing-Brussels and Beijing-Moscow.Spring Airlines told the Global Times that it carried 2.7 million passengers during this year's Spring Festival travel season, and its flight volume recovered to about 88 percent of the 2019 level.The number of international routes of Spring Airlines has been restored to 24, and it is expected that the number will reach 30 by the end of this month.""We plan to continue to introduce new aircraft this year, and we hope to attract college students with good foreign language skills for the resumption of international flights,"" Xiao said.

Untold numbers of people are still buried in the debris, and Turkey is calling for urgent rescue operations.The company said that more than a dozen excavators of various sizes and other heavy equipment will join the rescue work.Aid supplies have been mobilized, with the first batch valued at more than 50,000 Turkish lira ($2,655) purchased and delivered five hours after the quake on Tuesday, XCMG said. This batch includes blankets, baby products and hygiene products, and more aid is on the way.SANY Group, another major Chinese producer of heavy machinery, told the Global Times on Wednesday that it has excavators in Turkey, which will be coordinated as part of the company's contribution to the rescue work.""We will participate in the rescue as part of our corporate social responsibility,"" an employee of the company said. The earthquake has had only a limited impact on the company's global businesses.Turkey also has one of the largest BRI projects in the region - the Hunutlu Thermal Power Plant, a landmark project, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake in Adana.Thanks to the reliable quality of Made-in- China equipment, the project was undamaged during the quake. It has remained operational, providing electricity at a time of need, the Global Times learned from China Energy Engineering Corp (Energy China), the designer of the power station.The power plant continues to generate electricity, which offers a guarantee to the aid work, even as two nearby power plants were knocked offline by the quake and reduced power supply in the region, Energy China said.The direct impact of the disaster is limited so far for Chinese companies and projects in the region.Employees at a branch company of PowerChina in Istanbul, which is far away from the epicenter, said that work is proceeding as normal.XCMG told the Global Times that the supply of materials in Ankara, where a branch company is located, is adequate at the moment, but logistics have been disrupted by the quake.China has been beefing up support for the rescue work in Turkey and neighboring regions. During a regular press conference on Wednesday, the spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mao Ning said that after more than 10 hours of flying, 82 members of the Chinese rescue team arrived at the airport in the southern Turkish city of Adana in the early hours of Wednesday, with over 20 tons of aid supplies.

At that time, the city's economic output was second to the last in Fujian,"" the local resident surnamed Li recalled. But now Ningde is a household name, Li said, thanks to the rapid rise of electric battery titan Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which was set up in 2011.Another local resident surnamed Chen, a teacher in the city's largest vocational college, told the Global Times that automobile maintenance has become the ""hottest"" major among students in Fujian, especially those tailored-made classes for those who sign employment contracts with CATL and the giant automaker SAIC Motor. ""Last year, more than 400 students learning EV graduated, and the employment rate hits 100 percent because automakers here are in dire need of skilled workers,"" Chen explained, adding that she has already received consulting calls from many students' parents in January, who look to enroll their children in the school's auto-related subject this fall.A place making strides in social and economic development is usually inseparable from leading companies starting from scratch. For Ningde, the role is undoubtedly played by CATL. Usually, a lithium-ion battery cell will roll off the assembly line every 1.7 seconds in the Lighthouse factory of CATL, which will be assembled into a battery module every 20 seconds. For every three EVs in the world, one could be equipped with CATL-made batteries.CATL installed 165.7 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells from January to November in 2022, up 101.8 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to SNE Research. The company's global market share rose from 32.8 percent at the end of 2021 to 37.1 percent last year. It has remained the world's largest vehicle battery maker for six consecutive years.Propped up by CATL, Ningde introduced other leading players such as state-owned automaker SAIC Motor, which started production of its new vehicle assembly plant in 2019.Led by these behemoths, Ningde has more than 80 projects over the battery-making industrial chain, and it has forged a comprehensive technology deployment ranging from raw materials, modules and battery management systems to battery recycling, a representative of Ningde's publicity department told the Global Times.The localization rate of main materials in the battery industry has reached more than 60 percent, enabling Ningde to become the world's largest production base of polymer lithium-ion batteries, the representative said.In 2022, Ningde's lithium-ion new-energy sector achieved an output value of 275.8 billion yuan ($40.7 billion), a jump of 74.6 percent from 2021, driving an increase of 20.3 percentage points in the industrial added value and becoming the city's first industrial cluster that exceeded 200 billion yuan in revenues.The city aims to bring its lithium-ion new energy sector to the level of 500 billion yuan by 2025 by accelerating the building-up of a comprehensive supporting facility that will meet domestic demand and also serve global markets.Thanks to its industrial advantages, Ningde's economic output reached 355.4 billion yuan last year, up 10.7 percent year-on-year, much higher than the national average of 3 percent. The city topped others in Fujian in terms of seven major economic indicators out of 12, according to a local government report in January. Behind the success of CATL and the thriving electric battery industry in Ningde is the nation's resolve in pushing forward green growth and achieving the ""dual carbon"" goals. China aims to reach CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. New-energy vehicles, including pure battery vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel-cell vehicles, have become a strategically important emerging industry in China that's believed to play a driving role in fighting climate change.China has been the world's largest NEV market for seven years in a row. Sales of NEVs continued to soar last year, driven by the rising market demand and sound policy environment. Sales reached 6.89 million units, skyrocketing 93.4 percent on a yearly basis, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).NEV production soared 96.9 percent from a year earlier to about 7.06 million units in 2022.Thanks to the NEV boom, the share of NEVs in China's auto market reached 25.6 percent in 2022, up 12.1 percentage points from 2021.For 2023, a robust NEV market could be anticipated with the country's optimized COVID-19 management, which could help spur consumer spending and boost supply chains. The CAAM forecast that China's NEV sales would grow 35 percent year-on-year to 9 million units in 2023.                         "

By ramping up anti-China hysteria, political elites can accumulate political capital, but it may become a cancer that erodes the US economy.A number of elected officials - from a former presidential nominee to a backbencher lawmaker - have been involved over the past few days, NBC News reported. ""A big Chinese balloon in the sky and millions of Chinese TikTok balloons on our phones. Let's shut them all down,"" US Senator Mitt Romney said on Twitter. ""Now blow up TikTok,"" tweeted Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, after the US shot down the Chinese civilian airship.The Chinese airship is a civil aircraft with seriously limited self-steering capability that entered US airspace unintentionally due to force majeure. However, the endless hype made by US politicians and the hysterical overreaction of using the F-22 Raptor, the US Air Force's crown jewel, to shoot down a ""balloon,"" reflect nothing but the chaotic and sick political situation in Washington. It is not only a joke but also a political trick. In Washington, the atmosphere is like facing a formidable enemy, but the opponent is just a ""balloon."" The US has obviously overreacted, as some politicians believe ramping up anti-China hysteria can help them gain a political advantage. Currently, some US politicians are in a frantic race over who is tougher on China and the hysteria has made them lose basic objectivity on China-related issues. The Chinese airship is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes. It has nothing to do with TikTok, a popular short-video sharing platform. It is ridiculous to involve a short-video app into the recent airship incident.TikTok operates in the US in full compliance with US laws and is completely cut off from Douyin, its Chinese equivalent. The company has long said that it stores US user data within the US, but some US politicians are still committed to unjustifiably suppressing the short-video app, citing security concerns without any factual basis and evidence. Although an escalating US crackdown on TikTok is a distorted hegemonic behavior that violates market principles, some US politicians tried to defend themselves. However, using the airship incident to attack TikTok fully exposes the absurdity of an escalating US crackdown on the short-video app. It seems some US politicians have lost their rationality in dealing with TikTok-related issue.Now, there are a growing number of US political elites that wants to crack down on the video-sharing platform, with some trying to ban it completely. US President Joe Biden said on Monday he was not sure if Washington would ban TikTok, Reuters reported.Questions have been raised on what would happen if the US bans TikTok completely. TikTok is one of the world's most popular social media apps and is reportedly available in more than 150 markets. Internet, to a certain extent, represents the direction of technology and market development. At the very least, an escalating US crackdown on TikTok will harm US internet diversity and restrain market competition.The US economy would pay a price for Washington's distorted hegemonic behavior. The rest of the world shouldn't follow the US steps on suppressing TikTok because the US crackdown on TikTok is just a political farce that would hurt its own economy.                         "

Experts urged Australia to seize this important opportunity to inject more positive factors into their economic cooperation for mutual benefit.The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that China will restart and resume dialogues and exchanges with Australia, expand cooperation and control differences to boost the rebuilding of mutual trust and bring relations back to a normal track.The bulk vessel Magic Eclipse, which is reportedly carrying the coal from Australia, departed from Hay Point on January 24 before heading to a port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province. The ship is due to arrive at 10 pm (Beijing time) on Wednesday, according to MarineTraffic, a vessel tracking platform.The first batch of the Australian coal will be delivered to a local production base of Baoshan Iron & Steel Co (Baosteel) in Zhanjiang, insiders said. An employee with the company declined to comment when being reached by the Global Times on Wednesday, but said that the company is paying close attention to Australian coal imports.It's the first shipment of Australian coal in over two years, after former Australian prime minister Scott Morrison sabotaged bilateral relations.The resumption of Australian coal exports came after video talks between Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and his Australian counterpart Don Farrell on Monday.""The breakthroughs are within expectations, reflecting the general trend of the restoration of China-Australia economic and trade relations,"" Wang Shiming, a professor at the School of Politics and International Relations of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.The strained bilateral relationship in recent years caused much damage to the Australian economy, so it's one of the most important tasks for Australia's new Labor government to improve relations with China, he said, and a requirement for the development of the China-Australia comprehensive strategic partnership.There is huge room for economic and trade cooperation, including deepening cooperation in third-party markets. However, Australia's double standards such as tightened security reviews of Chinese companies' investment and operations in Australia would hinder the normalization of relations, Wang said.A healthy and stable relationship between China and Australia, which are both important countries in the Asia-Pacific region and have highly complementary economic structures, serves the fundamental interests of both peoples and is conducive to peace, stability and prosperity in the region, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a press briefing on Wednesday.China is ready to work with the Australian side to implement the important consensus reached by the two countries' leaders during the G20 summit in Bali and the results of the China-Australia Foreign and Strategic Dialogue, Mao said.China is a prime market for Australian goods such as coal, iron ore and wine. However, many of these goods lost ground in the Chinese market as domestic companies sought alternatives to reduce the risks from disruption amid cooled relations.Bilateral trade stood at $220.91 billion in 2022, down 3.9 percent year-on-year, according to China's General Administration of Customs. Australian exports to China fell 13.1 percent year-on-year to reach $142.09 billion last year.Trade with China is more than the next three largest trading partners combined. It's in Australia's national interests to have good economic relations and to trade with China, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday, Reuters reported.""Our position on China is clear that we will cooperate where we can, disagree where we must and engage in our national interests,"" he said.Zhou Fangyin, a research fellow at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, told the Global Times on Wednesday that Australia has become more pragmatic in its foreign policy, and further recognized the value of China's market for its economy.""Along with the restoration of bilateral ties, cooperation in sectors, including trade and tourism, is expected to be promoted,"" Zhou said, noting that ""Australia will eventually find out where its interests lie.""Immediately following signals of easing in the relationship, Australian businesses started to take a close look at trade resumption.A Tianjin-based trader surnamed Li told the Global Times on Wednesday that there is a growing expectation and possibility for more Australian hay to be exported to China.""As other products [such as coal] are coming in, the full resumption of hay shipments could just be a matter of time,"" he said.

Economy,By Wang Yi  |  2023/2/8 23:08:36,China's recovery biggest certainty to global economy; 'inflation threat' hype absurd,Western media's “inflation threat” hype on China's economic recovery does not hold water. China's recovery is the biggest certainty in the global economy in 2023. Western countries should drop political bias and try to take advantage of China's rebound.,https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-08/de627e12-f63a-4735-a9f0-68d48c4b3d49.jpeg," China reopening is a ""wild card"" for Canada to avoid a possible recession this year, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing analysts. While admitting Canada's economy will be beneficiary China's economic recovery, the report continued the ""inflation threat"" hype among foreign media outlets recently, claimed commodity prices rise driven by the rebound of the second largest economy will cause ""inflationary pressure.""Since China's economic recovery has picked up momentum after implementing a range of optimized epidemic control measures, some Western media outlets have started a new round of smearing and coming up with the ""inflation threat"" narrative. The Bloomberg said last week that China's economic recovery could offset weakness in Europe and a recession in the US, but also is the ""next big threat to global inflation.""It should be noted that such ""inflation threat"" hype has twisted the facts and does not hold water. When China's GDP grew rapidly at a 6.1-percent rate in 2019, the global inflation rate was 2.19 percent. In comparison, when China's GDP grew by 3 percent in 2022, the global inflation rate rose to 8.8 percent. It's crystal clear that China's economic growth is not the cause for global inflation, and the ""inflation threat"" narrative is nothing but a far-fetched new theory concocted by those who would discredit the Chinese economy under any circumstances.Contrary to what Western media outlets claim, China has kept its inflation stable. The consumer price index climbed 1.8 percent in December, well beneath the US' annual inflation rate of 6.5 percent and the EU's 9.2 percent in the same month. The high inflation that plagued the global economy in 2022 is the result of a series of complex factors, but the irresponsible monetary policies of Western economies led by the US cannot shirk responsibility. Western sanctions against Russia and the fallout of Western economies' excessive stimulus since the COVID-19 pandemic pushed up the commodity prices, driving the price index in the US and other countries soared to a new high in 40 years.China's reopening and economic recovery in 2023 is a ""clear-cut positive"" to the global economy rather than the so-called threat. And China's economic recovery is the biggest certainty rather than a ""wild card"" to other economies including Canada this year. China's economy is now widely forecast to rebound strongly in 2023. China's economic recovery will provide impetus to the world economy. International organizations and investment banks recently intensively raised their projections for China's economic growth in 2023 following impressive recovery of the country's consumption market during the Spring Festival holidays. The Chinese economy is projected to grow 5.2 percent year-on-year in 2023, the IMF said in its latest World Economic Outlook, up 0.8 percentage points from its projection in October. Morgan Stanley raised its outlook for China's GDP growth this year to 5.7 percent from 5.4 percent, predicting that a rebound in activity will come earlier and be sharper than expected, according to media reports.At a time of mounting challenges for the global economic recovery, great expectations have been placed on China. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in January that ""there is a great deal of hope that China's reopening would lead through 2023 to a better impact on global growth,"" according to media reports.Whether countries can catch the opportunities brought by China's rebound depends on whether they can drop political bias and remains rational in promoting economic and trade cooperation with China. Instead of wasting time hyping up nonsense about the ""inflation threat,"" Western countries should focus on coping with their own economic challenges and discuss expanding economic and trade cooperation with China so as to better take advantage of China's economic rebound.

The rulebook covers a wide range of areas from governance to industrial development, as well as the livelihoods of Macao residents and their legal protection.Experts described the launch of the rules as a milestone with a far-reaching impact and great significance. The rules lay the ground for more frequent person-to-person exchanges, they said.Hengqin aims to offer convenience for Macao residents in all aspects from education and jobs to entrepreneurship, livelihoods and social services.One of the major initiatives, known as the Hengqin New Neighborhood, a complex including primary schools, as well as elder and childcare services, is expected to be completed later this year and offer 4,000 homes for Macao residents.The rules spell out tax cuts for enterprises and professionals intending to move into the zone, with eligible businesses to be given a 15 percent reduction in corporation tax, and ""high-end talent"" working in Hengqin to pay 15 percent of their incomes only.For Macao residents working in the zone, the portion of their personal income tax burden that exceeds the tax burden of Macao will be exempted.In 2021, China released a general plan for building a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin, with some experts calling it the country's highest level of opening-up, in order to accelerate Macao's integration into the country's overall development. The plan, jointly released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the nation's cabinet, a 106-square-kilometer area of the zone is being set up as a ""major deployment"" by the central government to enrich the ""one country, two systems"" policy in practice, as well as provide important momentum for Macao's long-term development.The zone is being set up as China is pushing to further open up its economy to overseas investors, and mounting efforts to enhance the economic development of the Pearl River Delta with regional cooperation initiatives, particularly the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area initiative.As of Monday, the Chinese mainland had fully resumed normal travel with the Hong Kong and Macao SARs, in what is expected to be a strong boost for the two regions' economic development.

And for the world, it's a comeback of what was once its world's largest outbound travel market, it's also a prelude for a revival of the global tourism industry.A 24-person tour group for Thailand's Phuket Island organized by Shanghai Spring Tour is one of the first domestic tour groups to fly overseas since China resumed cross-border group tours. At around 7:30 am on early Monday, the Global Times saw that tourists started to come to the Shanghai Pudong International Airport to check in for the journey, with an obvious sentiment of excitement.The 6-day trip product was launched on January 20, when China announced the resumption of outbound group travel after a hiatus of more than 1,000 days. The product was sold out immediately that night, Zhou Weihong, deputy general manager of Shanghai Spring Tour, told the Global Times.The same day, group tourists were also seen at airports of the capital city Beijing and South China's Guangzhou, leaving for countries like the UAE, Egypt, New Zealand and Singapore.The domestic enthusiasm for outbound trips has been fueling up recently in the week after the Chinese Spring Festival holidays - the booking volume of outbound group tours products increased by more than three times compared with the holiday period, data from Trip.com showed, reflecting a further recovery of domestic tourists' confidence in outbound travel.Demand for long-distance products is also recovering. Trip.com Group, formerly known as Ctrip, told the Global Times that its first New Zealand outbound tour group departing from Shanghai on March 18, with an average price of 27,999 yuan ($4,125) per person, was sold out immediately after it went on sale.China Eastern Airlines told the Global Times that its international routes are expected to reach 60 by the end of February, with Southeast Asian countries recovering at a faster speed among others. ""I feel really happy, as this journey makes me feel that people's lives are returning to normal after the lengthy combat with the coronavirus,"" one tourist told the Global Times at the Shanghai airport on Monday. She also said that she's thinking of traveling to Egypt this year to make up for regrets, as her travel plan in 2020 was aborted because of COVID-19. The 20 countries for pilot outbound group travel included Thailand, the Maldives, the UAE, Russia and New Zealand. Pre-pandemic hot destinations like South Korea and Japan are out of the list. The announcement has sparked a frenzy of trip planning and seen online searches for overseas destinations spike, with Thailand sticking hold to most popular destination among all. ""Chinese tourists are prone to choose countries that offer convenient, quick and favorable entry policy as their first stop, we are also exploring for more tourism products based on that demand, and make sure they won't be 'aggrieved' by some discriminative policies during the whole trip,"" Xu Xiaolei, marketing manager at China's CYTS Tours Holding Co, told the Global Times on Monday. The policy change from the world's second-largest economy has received a positive response from many countries, with officials and tourism practitioners across the world preparing for ceremonies and souvenirs in high anticipation for the return of Chinese tourists.""We have been waiting a very long time for this moment, but finally we make it,"" Nonglux Yooyendee, director of the Tourism Authority of Thailand Shanghai Office, who came in person to see the tourists off at a Shanghai airport, told the Global Times on Monday.The official expected that Thailand will have about 5 million Chinese tourists this year, which is about 50 percent of pre-pandemic level.Senior Thai government officials also lined up at a Bangkok airport on Monday morning to receive the first group of tourists from Guangzhou.  Chinese-language banners were set up at Don Mueang International Airport to greet Chinese tourists, which read ""Thailand always welcomes Chinese friends.""Chinese were the largest group of visitors to Thailand before the pandemic, accounting for about 28 percent of the record 40 million foreign arrivals in 2019, according to a report from Bloomberg.Welcoming ceremonies will also be held in Dubai and Egypt. According to media portal thepaper.cn, Chinese tourists will be greeted by local officials at the airport after their arrival in Dubai, and the 7-star Burj Al Arab Hotel will provide tourists with ""early check-in"" service for the first day.In Egypt, the local government will hold a welcome ceremony for Chinese tourists on the cruise ship in Aswan, and will present exquisite souvenirs.""We are very happy to be able to welcome Chinese visitors back to New Zealand as China is one of New Zealand's most important markets,"" Gregg Wafelbakker, the General Manager Asia of Tourism New Zealand, told the Global Times. ""China was New Zealand's second largest market pre-COVID. Chinese visitors contributed over NZ$1.7 billion to New Zealand's economy in 2019,"" said Wafelbakker.Daniela Chiani, Director Greater China of Switzerland Tourism, told the Global Times that Switzerland is honored to appear on the first batch of 20 pilot countries, and has made ""every preparation"" for the return of Chinese tourists. Apart from a stronger spending power compared with independent tourists, industry players said the comeback of large number of Chinese group tourists can help local tourism industries quickly restore confidence, build up capabilities, hiring, thus empowering a vital recovery.In 2019, Chinese citizens made 155 million outbound trips  and spent more than $133.8 billion, according to data released by the China Tourism Academy.""It's still a prelude,"" Xu Xiaolei said, introducing that the company now only launched  200 ""basic"" products for the first pilot 20 countries at the moment, about one tenth of the number for the pre-pandemic level in 2019.""We expect by the end of the first quarter, or the beginning of the second quarter, China will resume group tour services for more countries, in preparation for the traditional 'travel golden period' starting from May,"" Xu said.For countries that rely on tourism revenue, the comeback of Chinese tourists has brought hopes of economic rebound, and more importantly, adds optimism and helps them pull through from a possible economic downturn.The effect of stronger tourism activity due to the resumption of China's outbound group tour could boost Malaysia's GDP by at least 1 percentage point, UOB Global Economics & Market Research said on Friday, the Xinhua News Agency reported.According to the research house's economists, the boost will further support their baseline GDP growth forecast for Malaysia of 4 percent for 2023.Thailand's economy may accelerate and hit the 3.8 percent growth forecast provided its tourism sector will get a vital boost from China's reopening plans, according to a Reuters report in December, citing the Thai finance minister.Fitch Ratings said China's reopening is expected to further lift the tourism economy across the Asia-Pacific region. ""We expect a revival of Chinese outbound tourism to boost growth prospects in economies with substantial tourism sectors. Further upsides to government credit profiles could stem from its positive effect on domestic employment markets and the external services trade balance,"" Fitch Ratings said in a report sent to the Global Times.China's resumption of outbound group tours could bring more than $200 billion back to international tourism, the Financial Times reported in January.Due to the earlier-than-anticipated recovery after China's optimization of its COVID measures, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised its forecast for China's economic growth in 2023 to 5.2 percent a few days ago, up 0.8 percentage points from its projection in October, driven by a rebound in private consumption.The estimated 5.2 percent growth in China will contribute greatly to the global growth this year, Thomas Helbling, deputy director in the IMF's Asia Pacific Department, told the Global Times during a virtual press briefing on Friday.The official noted that spillovers of China's rebound will particularly be where there are strong trade linkages in tourism with many of the Asian neighbors including Thailand or the Philippines. ""Of course, the larger these linkages, the bigger will be the impact,"" Helbling said.                         "

Most of these studies have made accusations about ""debt traps,"" a ""lack of transparency,"" or ""pollution of the investment environment"" and ""cross-border corruption"" to denigrate the initiative. Meanwhile, the US also proposed the ""Build Back Better World (B3W)"" initiative as an alternative to the BRI.These strongly ideological political manipulations, think tank studies and news reports have seriously damaged the overall image of the BRI, and must be highly alarming to Chinese think tanks and academics, the report read.In order to meet external challenges, China should firmly refute the deliberate distortions about the BRI. In addition, the country should profoundly expose certain think tanks' attempts to discredit and smear the initiative.The reported also suggested that China should be highly vigilant against the US using the BRI to create unrest in countries along the route in an attempt to shift attention away from its domestic conflicts. In recent years, the US has repeatedly reneged on its international commitments and obligations under the banner of ""America First"" and has become the biggest ""troublemaker"" in the international community.The US has been creating tension and unrest in countries and regions along the BRI, including man-made environmental damage, creating employment and livelihood crises and expanding debt risks, with serious impacts on the political security, social stability and peace of people in countries along the route. At present, as populism, extreme nationalism, trade protectionism and other anti-globalization ideas are prevalent in the US, some politicians often use external issues to cover up domestic conflicts, sparing no effort to attack and discredit China, and trying to weaken China's influence in countries along the BRI, the report noted.In order to address these challenges and further improve the quality of the BRI in the next 10 years, He Weiwen, a senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization, said on Wednesday that the BRI should become a strong and integral part of the existing multilateral mechanism.""The BRI is an integral part of the global infrastructure development goals, and we can cooperate with the US-proposed B3W and the EU's Global Gateway,"" He said.Global Times                          "

Brent crude slightly rose 0.09 percent as of 3:30 pm (Beijing time) to $85.17 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude climbed 0.04 percent to $78.5 per barrel.The rebound came after a massive quake that struck Turkey and Syria on Monday disrupted crude oil flows from Iraq and Azerbaijan via the Turkish port of Ceyhan, according to media reports.""The sudden disruption has a limited impact on international crude supply, as only a small amount of oil flows through the channel,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Turkey resumed its crude oil flows to the Mediterranean export terminal of Ceyhan late on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported, adding that Ceyhan exported more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, or 1 percent of global supplies.Being the world's largest oil importer, China's imported oil and natural gas accounts for about 28 percent of its total consumption, Lin said, adding China's energy supply is ensured despite an expected demand increase due to its stable economic recovery.The International Energy Agency predicted that world's oil demand would rise by 1.9 million bpd to a record 101.7 million bpd in 2023, with China accounting for half of the projected increase.China has attached great importance to oil and gas supply to ensure its domestic energy security amid international uncertainties. Chinese domestic oil and gas producers, such as China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), have ramped up efforts to increase supplies along with the steady recovery of the domestic economy and a remarkable rebound of Chinese consumption. According to data from CNPC, the company has supplied 29 billion cubic meters of natural gas so far this year, up 1.5 percent year-on-year, while its daily supply of refined oil rose 2.1 percent to 288,000 tons.China National Offshore Oil Corp, one of the country's three major oil and gas companies, told the Global Times on Thursday that the main structure of the Phase II of its Zhuhai Jinwan liquefied natural gas (LNG) Station in South China's Guangdong Province has been completed.

It marks the beginning of the recovery process for the Chinese airlines as they re-launch flights and re-establish China's connectivity with the rest of the world, Xie added. IATA said on Tuesday that the international passenger traffic of Asia-Pacific airlines in 2022 increased by 363.3 percent year-on-year in 2021, ranking first among all regions globally.The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) predicted on Wednesday that in the first quarter of 2023, air passenger demand on most routes around the world would recover rapidly to near pre-COVID-19 levels, and the demand will increase by about 3 percent above that of 2019 by the end of the year.At present, there are always some unfriendly voices, such as those advocating for specific travel restrictions on Chinese tourists in some countries.The US, Japan and South Korea are among the countries that announced restrictions on travelers from China, citing concerns that the current surge of COVID-19 cases in China could lead to the emergence of new variants.Spokesperson from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has for days urged countries to base their COVID response measures on science and not to resort to political manipulation or discriminatory measures targeting China.It was disappointing to see the knee-jerk reinstatement of COVID-19 testing and other measures solely for travelers from China by several countries in early January, especially when the virus is already circulating widely within their own borders, Xie said. The experience of the last three years has shown that these measures are ineffective in preventing the spread of the virus. Research undertaken around the arrival of the Omicron variant concluded that putting barriers in the way of travel made no difference to the peak spread of infections. At most, restrictions delayed that peak by a few days. If a new variant emerges in any part of the world, the same situation would be expected. That's why governments should listen to the advice of experts, including the WHO, that advise against travel restrictions, Xie added.   Today we have the tools to manage COVID-19 without resorting to ineffective measures that cut off international connectivity, damage economies and destroy jobs. Governments must base their decisions on scientific facts rather than political science, Xie noted. China announced on January 29 that it planned to resume issuing visas to Japanese that same day, after the Japanese Embassy in China resumed visa applications for Chinese nationals, a move widely regarded as a positive sign for travel and communications between Chinese and Japanese people.Recent moves by both China and Japan to remove some of the temporary travel restrictions are encouraging, Xie said.                          "
Economy,By Liu Caiyu and Xing Xiaojing in Khunjerab Port  |  2023/2/9 20:20:39,"GT on the spot: Khunjerab Port linking China and Pakistan emerges from pandemic, looking forward to greater growth in 2023","Driving along the China-Pakistan Friendship Road in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County in Northwest China's Xinjiang region, a fleet of trucks carrying walnuts, groceries and auto parts slowly pulled out of Khunjerab Port one by one, and entered Pakistan. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-09/328fe02f-be69-466e-8e60-20698e66784a.jpeg," Driving along the China-Pakistan Friendship Road in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County in Northwest China's Xinjiang region, a fleet of trucks carrying walnuts, groceries and auto parts slowly pulled out of Khunjerab Port one by one, and entered Pakistan. It is the second temporary opening of Khunjerab Port this year at Pakistan's request to facilitate customs clearance for supplies. And it's the only land port linking China and Pakistan. In the three years since COVID-19 erupted in 2020, Khunjerab Port, like all other land crossings in China on the forefront of guarding against imported COVID-19 cases, shut down its passenger pass entirely. The Port opened for occasional emergency cargo transportation.""But this time, cross-border drivers can drive their truck heading to Pakistan directly, unlike during the epidemic when they had to leave their cargo in designated areas after rounds of disinfection, with the Pakistani side coming to pick them up the following day,"" Zhang Xiaobo, the customs director at the Khunjerab Port, said.The customs clearance processes have resumed to pre-COVID settings. As the region's epidemic situation stabilizes, the passenger crossing service is projected to resume when the port fully opens in April, Zhang noted. China downgraded its managementof COVID-19 from Class A to Class B as of January 8.""I was very happy and relieved when I drove my truck off to Pakistan this time. I don't need to wear masks that make breathing difficult in such high-altitude, and wear protection suits that enveloped my entire body in,"" said cross-border freight driver Wang Chuanhai. This year the 54-year-old driver has already twice passed the snow-capped port to Sost Dry Port in Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region during temporary openings. The current temporary opening will last 12 days between January 30 and February 10. The first port opening was between January 19 and 20.The two temporary openings have facilitated 128 cross-border personnel visits, 328 transportation vehicles' passes, and more than 6,000 tons of goods exported.The freight volume, at a standstill for the past three years, will bottom out and rebound, and the record high of 100,000 tons of freight volume is expected to be achieved this year. Improved momentum lies ahead in the post-epidemic era as China and Pakistan continue to deepen the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). ""We expect to witness a huge compensatory growth of cross-border trade and transportation in this year at the Khunjerab Port,"" Ye Hailin, deputy director-general at National Institute of International Strategy of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), told the Global Times.The port saw more than 200 vehicles throughout 2021, and in 2022 the port dispatched around 600 vehicles worth of cargo, but in 2023 since the grand reopening, a total of 5,000 vehicles worth of goods are expected to be delivered to neighboring countries through the port, said Wang Shicheng, the general manger of a logistic company in Kashi. During the two periods of temporary opening, Wang Shicheng sent more than 30 trucks loaded with groceries, auto parts, polyester cloth and clothing from the port into Pakistan.""We've suffered 30 million yuan ($4.41 million) in losses over the past three years because of the epidemic, but after China downgraded its COVID-19 management, I'm confident we will win back our losses soon, likely within the next year and a half,"" said Wang Shicheng, owner of more than 130 cross-border trucks. Because of cold weather and thin air, Khunjerab Port, seated on mountains of altitudes of 5,000 meters, generally opens from April 1 to November 30 every year, and remains closed from December 1 to March 31. Wang Shicheng declined many phone calls when talking with Global Times reporters. Though there is about two months before Khunjerab Port fully opens in April, logistic orders from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Pakistan have filled up Wang Shicheng's daily schedule. Many of his foreign customers cannot wait to pass the border for trade and business and strike a deal in-person, rather than making orders online as they were doing during the epidemic.Making Khunjerab Port a year-long operation has been one of the targets for the region in 2023, the Global Times learnt from a foreign affairs office in Kashi prefecture. If the initiative is approved, it is expected to drive cross-border trade and business. People passing by always would like to pose for a photograph with a huge board reads ""Long Live China-Pakistan Friendship"" in front of the outpost of exit/entry border checkpoint at the Khunjerab Port.Doing business with Pakistan is a source of pride for drivers, businessmen and officials from both sides. Driver Wang Chuanhai cannot cover his joy when recalled of how he was welcomed by Pakistani people with milk tea when he drove there. ""Pakistani people are really friendly to Chinese. We don't have to worry about experiencing unexpected emergency there. When we're in difficulty, they always reach out to help. Once Pakistani security forces protected us to deliver the cargo to Karachi, and three patrolling planes watched from the sky."" Wang Shicheng said doing business with Pakistan makes him proud. Wang Shicheng is confident over an increase in his business in the post-epidemic era, especially now that cold-chain warehouses backed with 80 million yuan in investment by Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County are completed.Now seafood from the Indian Ocean can be imported directly from Pakistan, something unimaginable a few years ago, same as Buffalo embryos, forage grass, and fresh fruits like mango and cheery, Jiang Wenjie, a customs officer said when he talked with Global Times reporters in front of the gateway of China at the port.The cargo volume between China and Pakistan at Khunjerab Port peaked at 83,000 tons in 2017. Though under the epidemic in 2022, the Khunjerab Port achieved a substantial increase in cargo clearance, a total of 22,600 tons of goods were exported that year, an increase of 358.9 percent over 2021.The freight volume, at a standstill for three years, will soon rebound, and the record high of 100,000 tons of freight volume is expected to be achieved this year, according to Zhang, the customs director at the Khunjerab Port. Not only serving as a border for entering and exiting China and Pakistan, the Khunjerab Port also receives travelers from other countries, with generally at least 15,000 people coming from more than 30 countries and regions passing through each year, Jiang noted. Though being China's westernmost and highest port in the world, the pass is able to deliver cargo from provinces across the country to neighboring countries in hours. Wang Shicheng's trucks are loaded with groceries from East China's Zhejiang Province, agricultural products from Xinjiang, induction heaters from South China's Guangdong Province and mechanical equipment from East China's Jiangsu Province. ""It's role as a gateway linking western China together with South Asian and Central Asian countries could only become bigger in the coming years, Now the China-Pakistan railway is being planned and  - China's westernmost airport and the first Xinjiang airport of ultra-high altitude - has officially opened to traffic, I see no reason to stop Khunjerab Port from continuing to open up,"" Jiang said. Counsellor of the State Council and economist Justin Lin Yifu, who paid a visit to the Port on Tuesday, holds the same opinion.  ""Khunjerab Port has a good momentum of development in all aspects, including infrastructure, and with the development of China's economy and the further construction of the CPEC, the port can play an increasingly important role."" Khunjerab Port as the only land port between China-Pakistan is irreplaceable as the CPEC continues to deepen, Ye from the CASS noted. But many obstacles lie ahead for the port to realize full potential. Being extremely cold and located at high altitude is one of apparent natural factors that impede border trade. Neighboring areas of the two countries at the pass are both economically underdeveloped areas and it is very difficult for such places to carry out border port trade, Ye said. Cases of cross-border drivers suffering from altitude sickness are not rare, the Global Times learnt. The throughput of Suster Port in Pakistan was designed to be as much as 100,000 tons, and the mechanization and automation of cargo handling was low, which resulted in the backlog of vehicles and goods to a certain extent. The cargo clearance capacity at the Port could further improve if the hardware infrastructure construction of the Pakistani side could develop accordingly as the CPEC continues to advance, Jiang said.                          "

An endless stream of cargo trucks passed through the port and on the roadside, and long lines of trucks and excavators were waiting to be transported across the border to Russia. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-09/db764762-d9dc-486e-8f76-d7e2ac79e7cf.jpeg," On a cold Thursday at the Manzhouli port in North China's Inner Mongolia, the roar of trucks and excavators was constant. An endless stream of cargo trucks passed through the port and on the roadside, and long lines of trucks and excavators were waiting to be transported across the border to Russia. The busy scene at the largest land port between China and Russia captures the fast-rising bilateral trade, with cargo traffic through the port hitting a record in the first month of 2023. Amid surging Russian demand for Chinese goods ranging from vegetables to machinery and China's resumption of normal port operations, local cargo forwarders expect even busier times in the coming months. ""The surge in exports to Russia [via Manzhouli] started in 2020 when other ports were closed and traffic was moved here, and the surge will continue. I feel that Russia's demand for Chinese products is getting bigger and bigger,"" Xiao Yanhao, who runs a freight forwarding company in Manzhouli, told the Global Times on Thursday. Xiao said that facing Western sanctions, Russia has become more reliant on alternative products from China, and that trend is especially vivid at the Manzhouli port. ""There used to be lull seasons and peak seasons… but now it feels that there is always a lot of traffic,"" he said. The trend is reflected in official data. In January, cargo traffic through the Manzhouli border crossing reached record high, Russian news outlet Sputnik reported on Saturday, citing the Russian Consulate General in Harbin, Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. During the month, cargo volume on the cross-border railway between Manzhouli and Russia's Zabaikalsk surged by 82.9 percent year-on-year to around 1.5 million tons, the consulate general said, adding that bilateral trade is expected to keeping rising following China's grand reopening, according to Sputnik. In 2022, China's trade with Russia hit a record of 1.28 trillion yuan ($190 billion), increasing 34.3 percent year-on-year, according to Chinese customs data. China and Russia have set a goal of lifting bilateral trade to $200 billion annually by 2024, and they're on track to meet that goal. Freight forwarders in Manzhouli are confident that bilateral trade will grow rapidly, as Russian demand for Chinese goods continues to rise. ""Their demand for products has become largely reliant on China, with Russian clients coming to find Chinese clients to buy a lot of products,"" Jiang Tao, who also runs a freight forwarding company in Manzhouli, told the Global Times on Thursday. Jiang said that Russian demand for Chinese components, daily necessities, construction equipment and trucks in particular saw a surge, as supplies from countries like Germany and Japan were hit by Western sanctions. Efforts by authorities at the port to ensure smooth operations amid the epidemic also played a major role in ensuring stable trade between China and Russia. Jiang said that cargo volume dropped during the initial stage of pandemic, but it has seen steady rise since last year. Only around 20 cargo trucks passed through the port during the early days of pandemic, but it has risen to about 200, according to Jiang.  Xiao's company also saw a surge in the number of cargo trucks through Manzhouli, with the number hitting 2,000 in 2022, up about 500 from 2021. Each truck carries about 20 tons of goods, indicating the rapid rise in cargo volume, according to Xiao. Due to the combined impact of the international situation, economic stagnation and the virus, global sea and air transport fares surged, which boosted the role of Manzhouli as a major land port helping stabilize supply chains for neighboring countries along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the local customs authority said in a statement sent to the Global Times on Thursday. The statement said that to bolster the port's important role, Manzhouli customs in 2022 took 20 measures to boost foreign trade, including improving port efficiency. Due to such efforts, Manzhouli has become a major port for exports of large construction machinery. In 2022, construction machinery exported via Manzhouli surged 220.4 percent year-on-year to more than 21,600 units, according to the statement. ""Due to disrupted port operations caused by the pandemic, various departments made a lot of efforts, including coordination and extended work times. They are befitting of the biggest [land port],"" Xiao said. With disruptions from COVID-19 having been eliminated and China-Russia bilateral trade continuing to surge, local authorities and businesses will continue to hear the nonstop roar of trucks and machinery, and watch the endless line of trucks in the foreseeable future.

In particular, Cambodian officials might seek support from China to build a high-speed railway, the report said.Cambodia is moving to build a high-speed train system connecting Phnom Penh and its Banteay Meanchey province, which shares a border with Thailand, using a concessional loan from China, reports said. The project's feasibility study has been conducted.The possible cooperation should add another high-profile project to a pool of infrastructure projects built by Chinese companies in Cambodia. Some are already operating and generating economic benefits for local people, while work on others has just started.One example is the Lower Sesan 2 Hydro Power dam, which was built and managed by China Huaneng Group. The dam is Cambodia's largest hydropower station and accounts for about one-fifth of the country's annual power generation. Wang Hailong, who is in charge of public relations for the project, told the Global Times on Thursday that since the station was put into operation in 2008, China Huaneng has trained more than 200 local technicians and managers. The company also created more than 2,000 jobs for local people at the peak of construction.The project led to the relocation of 840 households and 3,690 poor people in the surrounding area, helping them move to villages with better living conditions, he said.Huaneng used technologies like smart power plants and remote control as part of the project, he said. In January, Hun Sen presided over a groundbreaking ceremony for a 45.5-kilometer stretch of National Road 7 being upgraded from two lanes to four. The project was carried out by China Road and Bridge Corp, a Phnom Penh Post report noted. Gu Xiaosong, dean of the ASEAN Research Institute of Hainan Tropical Ocean University, told the Global Times that well-operating infrastructure projects built by Chinese firms in Asia, like the China-Laos Railway, have provided successful cases for countries like Cambodia.With better connectivity with its neighbors, Cambodia can develop at a faster pace, Gu said. China-Cambodia trade will also get a strong boost if there's land infrastructure to ship products between the two, presumably via neighboring nations like Thailand. Wang Xudong, secretary-general of the Cambodia Chinese Chamber of Commerce, told the Global Times on Thursday that after a prolonged war in Cambodia, the country's infrastructure is quite weak. Roads, airports and ports need improvement, and there are hardly any rail facilities.""China and Cambodia have cooperated in a great variety of fields, especially in infrastructure... there are many hydropower stations in Cambodia, and about 35 percent of roads, as well as important bridges, were built by Chinese companies, with more cooperation likely,"" Wang said.Wang Hailong said that Cambodia, which is rich in hydropower, photovoltaic and wind power clean energy resources, needs a complete energy infrastructure network. As China has advantages in power generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure, there's a potential for cooperation.Cooperation in other sectors is also expected to accelerate, particularly after China reopened its borders around the end of last year.Wang Xudong said that ""Cambodia exports agricultural products such as rice and fruit, as well as mining resources, to China. The country is still developing, and it can use China's advanced products, equipment, technology and professional talent.""Cambodia's Ministry of Commerce aims to set up five Cambodian private business centers in major Chinese cities to promote Cambodian exports, the Khmer Times reported. Bilateral trade surged 17.5 percent on a yearly basis to $16 billion in 2022, customs data showed. Moreover, tourism is also recovering at an orderly pace. Cambodia welcomed 125 Chinese tourists from Beijing on Tuesday at the Phnom Penh International Airport. They were greeted by Cambodian Tourism Minister Thong Khon, according to the Xinhua News Agency.                         "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-07/005a3687-df6e-4aa0-8cfb-7d806eb288a9.jpeg," China's central bank on Thursday unveiled rules governing affiliate transactions of financial holding firms, in the latest effort to increase scrutiny of a vibrant part of the country's vast financial sector.The rules are intended to regulate related-party transactions of financial holding firms, foster stable operations of those firms and prevent financial risks, the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, said in a statement on its website. The new rules, approved at a PBC meeting in December, will come into force on March 1. Financial holding firms hold stakes in or control an array of institutions with complicated business and organizational structures. Factoring in their high volumes of financial activities and high levels of relatedness, reining in affiliate transactions plays a significant part in strengthening and improving oversight of these firms, read the PBC statement. Improved scrutiny of affiliate transactions is an important component of plans laid out by the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to enhance the mechanism for financial stability, the statement said.The new rules make it clear that financial holding firms have primary responsibility for management of affiliate transactions. They are expected to regulate internal transactions and operations, supervise and urge affiliated units to handle related-party transactions properly. The rules are envisioned to prevent the transfer of benefits, risk contagion and regulatory arbitrage, thereby improving the macro-prudential policy framework.Also, the new rules spell out what activities are off-limits, require the establishment of limits on the amount of affiliate transactions, and mandate the creation of special audit and internal accountability mechanisms.The move builds on efforts in recent years to put in place firewalls around big conglomerates that have ventured into financial services amid the nation's trailblazing progress in fintech acumen. Concerns about over-expansion and spillover risks across varied financial segments sped up China's regulatory toughening over financial holding firms, observers said.A major step toward this end was a set of rules for regulating financial holding firms, which went into effect on November 1, 2020.China's financial holding firms have developed at a fast pace in recent years, playing an active part in meeting the diversified needs of various market entities and serving economic development. But a few businesses blindly expanded into the financial sector, and risks had continuously piled up, Pan Gongsheng, a deputy PBC governor, told a media briefing in September 2020 that specifically focused on financial holding firms. Thursday's new rules take regulatory efforts to the next level as the PBC vowed to strengthen regulatory collaboration with other departments as part of a wider push for financial system stability.

Reflecting on the development of the BRI over the last decade, there has been no shortage of evidence demonstrating that it is a big success, a momentum that relentless Western crackdowns and smears are unable to reverse.Standing at this monumental juncture, the Global Times is publishing a series of articles to help readers understand the fruitful journey of the BRI over the last decade from multiple perspectives, and how the initiative will positively commence over the year. This is the third installment in the series, examining how the China-Europe freight train has boosted the dynamic of trade for dozens of cities on the Eurasian landmass.In 2013, there were just two trains departing from Erenhot, Inner Mongolia's second-largest land port and China's largest trade hub with Mongolia. Today, 43 trade routes covered by China-Europe freight trains connect over 50 domestic cities with over 40 localities and ports in nine countries including Russia, Finland, and Germany, according to media reports. At Manzhouli, which lies at the geographic center of the Northeast Asia economic bloc the number of trains has exceeded 17,000 traversing 57 trade routes after a decade of development. Cargo trains leaving China from here now connect over 60 domestic cities with 28 foreign cities in 11 European countries in an evolving trade web.The success of the China-Europe freight train service is a testament to how countries along the Eurasia route have worked toward common prosperity by reviving the old Silk Road through innovation.Li Xin, director of the Institute for Eurasian Studies at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Thursday that cooperation on a China-Europe freight train route between China and Russia opened a new chapter in the development of the service.China and Russia agreed to connect Russia's Trans-Eurasia railway with the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Maritime Silk Road at a top leaders' meeting in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, Li said, recalling the earliest days that saw the northern route of the China-Europe freight train route coming into existence.Back then, the cooperation of freight train service also helped the two countries align the BRI and Eurasian Economic Union development strategy, Li said.""With Russia onboard, the China-Europe freight train service naturally became a truly express route traversing the Eurasian landmass,"" Li said. ""Currently, almost all the cargo leaving Eeast China's cities will go through the eastern route of the freight train services.""Dozens of industrial cities on the landmass are connected with convenient door-to-door service.In East China's Jiangsu Province, an economic powerhouse and manufacturing hub, the port city of Lianyungang was connected with cities in Mongolia via the cargo trains; provincial capital Nanjing and Xuzhou, a major city in the north of the province, found Russian cities at the end of the trade route and Suzhou, a hub of multinational manufacturing capacity, was linked with European cities via cargo trains.Since 2021, Jiangsu has added a multimodal route between Suzhou and Helsinki, and the link that connects Xuzhou and Minsk, according to a statement by the Jiangsu International Freight Train Company sent to the Global Times on Thursday.Because of the train, many lesser-known cities in China were able to transport their industrial products to European markets. The hustle and bustle of the China-Europe freight train encapsulates Inner Mongolia's efforts to participate in the BRI and the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor.For instance, in Inner Mongolia, Chifeng exported its drive axle and engines to Moscow and Wulanchabu exported its chemical products to Duisburg, Germany in two separate China-Europe freight train services in 2022.After a decade of growth, Inner Mongolia's trade with Belt and Road markets now accounts for over 50 percent of its total foreign trade, customs authorities said.""The freight train service served like a lifeline to prosperity, bonding China's plan of revitalizing the old industrial base in Northeast China and Russia's plan to develop its Far East,"" Li said.It also fully tapped the advantage of Russia's century-old Siberia railway, which offered lower per-unit rates compared with China's, and the constantly increasing cargo volume will likely push Russia to complete its plans to upgrade the railway, according to Li. Because of the introduction of new routes and the efforts by countries along the China-Europe freight train service route to vie for more cargo throughput, the overall cost has been reduced by about 10 percent over the last decade, Li said.The cargo train service also contributed to the building of the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor, which has gained traction in recent years as highlighted by the three neighboring countries' push toward the bolstering of the Powerof the Siberia-2 pipeline, which will transport Russian gas to China via Mongolia.Li said the trilateral economic cooperation, focuses mainly on major projects in energy supply and also includes the building of communication lines and digital infrastructure, will eventually attract more Chinese investment to Mongolia's mining and manufacturing industries, and result in a deeper level of industrialization of the country. Construction of the Russian-Chinese natural gas pipeline transiting through Mongolia will begin in 2024, according to media reports. With a decade of development, the China-Europe freight train service is becoming the new transportation artery of China, Europe and Central Asia, carving out new opportunities for cooperation and resulting in a win-win situation, Liang Haiming, Dean of Hainan University Belt and Road Research Institute, told the Global Times on Thursday.Experts said, following the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the West's escalating sanctions against Russia, that Russia has become steadfast in pivoting toward the East and while there are also Japan and South Korea in this direction, the sheer size of trade volume between China and Russia has meant China will be the main actor.For cities like Manzhouli and Erenhot, which are at the center of this upward trend, the growth potential is simply unlimited, Li said.                          "

He urged the government to urgently come up with a plan to remove the cameras, Reuters reported.It would be unworthy if the Australian government were to damage the China-Australia relationship based on unsubstantiated rumors, amid warming relations between China and Australia, Chen noted.""It is hoped that the Australian government will handle it with wisdom,"" Chen said.China's Commerce Ministry on Thursday said that mutually beneficial economic and trade cooperation between China and Australia serves the common interests of both countries.Shu Jueting, spokesperson of the ministry, said on Thursday that China is willing to communicate with Australia on issues of mutual concern in bilateral trade and find mutually beneficial solutions. ""Meanwhile, we hope that Australia will work with China to provide a fair business environment for Chinese enterprises to invest and promote the high-quality development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation,"" Shu said.

Defense Minister Richard Marles was quoted as saying that ""where those particular cameras are found, they're going to be removed.""Without any evidence to prove that those ""particular cameras"" pose threat to national security, those devices shouldn't be treated unequally just because they come from Chinese companies. The Australian business community has been eagerly awaiting a boost in bilateral ties, and currently, it is in the critical period of pushing China and Australia economic and trade relations back on track. It would be deeply disappointing if the normal use of surveillance cameras hinders the hard-won atmosphere for expanding bilateral cooperation. We should not take risks just because of some politicians' narrow-minded geopolitical thinking. As bilateral relations are showing improving signs, many Western media reports focus mainly on Canberra's call for resumption of ""unimpeded trade,"" trying to exert pressure on the Chinese side and further complicate China-Australia relations. But it makes simple sense that, on the basis of mutual equality and mutual benefit, the improvement of bilateral relations requires joint efforts from both sides - not only China but also Australia.The relaxation and improvement of China-Australia relations have brought opportunities for some Australian companies to re-enter the Chinese market, with a highly anticipated consumption rebound, following China's optimized epidemic control measures and policies. The Australian business community has been eagerly awaiting trade improvement, but it should also be pointed out that a handful of people in Canberra are willing to act as a US chess piece and continue to use the so-called human rights issue, national security issue and others to slander and attack China. Australia is a vital ally of the US. It comes as no surprise that Washington has notable influence on Canberra and some Australian politicians.Currently, political tensions between the US and China provoked by Washington have thrust technology and supply chains into the spotlight and threaten to fracture the recovery of the global economy. Some analysts believe the US hopes to use its allies, Japan and Australia included, to drag China into a costly and protracted strategic trap which consumes China's comprehensive strength and economic potential, and isolate China in the Asia-Pacific region. The US doesn't want to see China-Australia relations return to a normal, mutually beneficial state. The warmer China-Australia relations are, the more rabid some political elites will become. In the past few years, China-Australia relations have encountered difficulties and setbacks, which we do not want to see. During the most difficult period in China-Australia relations, why China-made surveillance cameras can be used in government buildings, and now, when bilateral relations are showing improving signs, Australian Defense Department has been under increased pressure to remove those cameras. The best explanation to the normal use of China-made cameras in the past is that those devices from the first place pose no threat to national security.The AP report said at least 913 cameras, intercoms, electronic entry systems and video recorders developed and manufactured by Chinese companies are in Australian government and agency offices. So far, there is no evidence to prove that any information collected by these devices can be sent back to China. Now, China-Australia relations have gone through difficulties and regained positive momentum. We should cherish the valuable and hard-won momentum that has been achieved through dialogues. The relaxation of China-Australia relations has boosted expectations for improving economic and trade ties between the two countries after years of tension. The trend should not be interrupted by narrow-minded geopolitical thinking.Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao on Monday held a video meeting with Australian Trade Minister Don Farrell. Wang said China pays close attention to Australia's tightening of security reviews on Chinese companies and hopes that Australia will properly handle relevant cases and provide Chinese companies with a fair, open and non-discriminatory business environment.Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Mininstry spokesperson, also said on Thursday that China opposes the wrong practice of     Better bilateral relations will set a very positive tone for economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, especially for Australia. Canberra should resist the pressure from Washington, try to manage irrational voices domestically, and continue to push China-Australia relations back on track.                         "
Economy,By Wang Yi  |  2023/2/10 0:43:32,Seasonal drop in Chinese auto sales in Jan won't drag growth on recovery in 2023,"The seasonal drop in Chinese auto sales in Jan won't drag growth on recovery in 2023. China's auto market is still in a strong position, and it will remain an important market for global auto manufacturers.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/30ad5556-7726-410d-b163-d9db60c6d6f7.jpeg," China's passenger car sales dropped 38 percent in January, with sales of new-energy vehicles (NEVs) falling 6.3 percent, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Wednesday. Demand across the Chinese market weakened after the tax cut on combustion engine cars and subsidies on NEVs expired, the Reuters reported.The sharp drop in auto sales in China in January was the result of a complex set of factors. Sales were mainly dragged down by seasonal factors and are expected to pick up in the coming months. It is too early to say that demand will weaken this year.First, Chinese people celebrated a full week of the Lunar New Year holidays during January, making it a quieter month compared with the previous years. Second, the end of NEV subsidies at the end of 2022 made consumers choose to buy before the expiration date. In December 2022, sales of NEVs surged by 90 percent. The seasonal decline in auto sales in China's auto market should not be over-interpreted.Although the sales decline was slightly lower than market expectations, the industry and companies had prejudged the situation and made necessary preparations. For instance, German auto manufacturer Volkswagen said in January that the first quarter will certainly be a bit more difficult in comparison to the rest of the year and they will take measures to offset the influences.Cui Dongshu, secretary general of CPCA Wednesday predicted that February is the real start-up month of the auto market this year. The quiet consumer market will present huge new investment and new consumption opportunities, and the demand in the fuel vehicle market recovery will pick up momentum.In fact, according to auto dealers across the country, the number of consumers watching and choosing cars during Spring Festival significantly exceeded expectations. With the recovery of China's economy and the introduction of more support measures, the recovery of the auto market will accelerate.Excluding seasonal factors, China's auto market is in a strong position, and it will remain an important market for global auto manufacturers. Although the Chinese auto market is facing the pressure of weakening demand this year, with the support of economic fundamentals and rebound, industry associations and companies are cautiously optimistic in the industry and in particularly confident in the growth in NEV market.In 2022, China's NEV sales have reached new highs. According to data from the CPCA, passenger car market retail was 20.7 million units in 2022, an increase of about 550,000 units from 20.15 million units in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 1.8 percent.It should be pointed out that the record high of China's auto sales in 2022 was achieved even under multiple pressures such as the impact of the epidemic that was worse than expectations and the pressure of supply chain disruptions. Considering that these negative factors will be removed in 2023, and the Chinese economy will usher in a strong rebound this year, the Chinese auto market will experience growth on recovery.The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers recently predicted that in 2023, China's total auto sales will reach 27.6 million, a year-on-year increase of 3 percent. Among these numbers, sales of NEVs are expected to reach nine million, a year-on-year increase of 35 percent.According to Bloomberg, Volkswagen expects to achieve recovery growth in the Chinese auto market as supply chain pressures and the epidemic ease. On January 16, Ralf Brandstaetter, chairman and CEO of Volkswagen Group China, said that it is expected that the sales volume of the Chinese passenger car market will increase by 4-5 percent in 2023, reaching 23 million vehicles.While growth will accelerate, foreign automakers are facing stronger competition from local Chinese manufacturers. In this regard, to maintain and expand their market share, foreign automakers need to step up efforts in meeting an evolving trend in China's auto industry and consumption.                         "

Considering that there are few options in the global currency market for benchmarking the US dollar system based on fintech, economic strength and trade scale, the yuan system is objectively the best solution for the de-dollarization of Russia and other countries, Chen Jia, an independent analyst on international strategy,?told the Global Times on Friday.This could be seen from the expanded yuan trading across the Moscow bourse after Western countries imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions in 2022. Yuan accounted for 48 percent of foreign exchange trading on the Moscow exchange in November 2022, up from 0.2 percent at the start of the year.The yuan is already having a significant impact on the ruble's exchange rate. The increase in the proportion of yuan trading volume and settlement will help stabilize the ruble exchange rate and improve the investment environment in the Russian economy, analysts noted.This is also a result of Western financial sanctions on Russia, which poised the latter to seek a safer currency, said analysts, adding that yuan's popularity among Russian entrepreneurs is evidence that companies are turning to new markets, particularly China.About 15 percent of Russian small and medium-sized enterprises used foreign exchange between May and October 2022, according to a report by the Russian Industrial Communications Bank. Of those using foreign exchange, 34 percent chose the US dollar, 31 percent chose yuan and 28 percent chose the euro.The survey noted that the yuan is favored because of increased trade with Asia and the lower payment risks associated with using the currency than the dollar and euro.The yuan has maintained relative stability in the face of US interest hikes and global inflation. This is the core reason why vast number of developing countries and emerging markets in the world, including Russia, keep increasing the share of yuan in their sovereign reserves, Chen said.Geopolitical competition is accelerating a global de-dollarization trend, Hong Yong, a research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Friday.""The role of the US dollar in the international financial market is not as strong as it used to be, and the US government has been increasing its control over the dollar, making many countries look for alternative currencies,"" said Hong.Hong also noted that as the US economy weakens, international confidence in the US dollar is declining, which will accelerate the de-dollarization process.

The drivers have to go through procedures at the hall before they are allowed to enter the city to pick up construction vehicles and drive them back to Russia. Trucks taking goods such as soybean oil from Russia continually passed through the guard points of the Heihe port via the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge and parked in front of the arrival hall while awaiting handling procedures. The Heihe highway port officially resumed two-way customs clearances for goods exchanges on Friday. As of 2 pm that day, the port had conducted clearances for more than 100 vehicles and 1,800 tons of goods, China Central Television reported. ""Since the outbreak of the epidemic three years ago, we have been conducting non-contact security checks on entry personnel in accordance with national requirements,"" Lu Xiao, a deputy captain on duty at the Heihe Entry-Exit Border Inspection Station, told the Global Times. ""Now, with the adjustment of the policy, we are able to conduct face-to-face checks, which is much more convenient for both travelers and the border guards,"" he said.Lu expected that with temperatures rising, cross-border tourists will gradually return to Heihe, and the number of visitors will peak in summer, the May Day holiday and the National Day holidays.According to China Central Television, the number of cross-border trips made via the Heihe port exceeded one million in 2019. Across the Heilongjiang River, the city of Heihe neighbors Blagoveshchensk, the capital city of Russia's Amur Oblast, which is also an important town in the Far East of Russia. Heihe port is not only an important channel for imports and exports, but also a gateway through which Chinese and Russian tourists go to each other's countries.According to the Heihe customs, the total value of imports and exports in goods made in Heihe exceeded 16.5 billion yuan ($2.4 billion) in 2022, the highest since 2014.The Heihe-Blagoveshchensk cross-border highway bridge was officially opened in June, 2022. With a length of 1,284 meters and a width of 14.5 meters, the cross-border highway bridge is a key part of a 19.9 km-long highway project that links the Jilin-Heilongjiang expressway in northeast China and a highway in Blagoveshchensk.This bridge is expected to become a new westward Eurasian passageway linking China and Russia, which will be of great significance to promoting the high-quality development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries.In 2022, China's trade with Russia hit a record 1.28 trillion yuan ($190 billion), increasing 34.3 percent year-on-year, according to Chinese customs data. China and Russia have set a goal of lifting bilateral trade to $200 billion annually by 2024, and they are on track to meeting it.  Heihe merchants are confident that bilateral trade will grow this year along with the shift in COVID-19 measures and the opening of the Heihe-Blagoveshchensk bridge.For some of the Russian drivers, it is their first time coming to Heihe since China downgraded its COVID-19 measures. This means that after three years, they can contact Chinese border inspection personnel face-to-face and experience an offline inspection procedure for the first time.  Anatolii Agoshkov, a 60-year-old Russian truck driver, told the Global Times at the arrival hall on Friday that he was so happy and excited to meet the inspection personnel at the Heihe port, whom he considers his old friends, face-to-face after three years.Agoshkov came to Heihe as a truck driver in 1990 for the first time. Over the past 30 years, he said he has witnessed great changes in the border city and cannot wait to visit it with his family and taste his favorite local barbecue.  Liu Haoxin, a police officer, was on duty on Friday in the falling snow at the No.1 post of Heihe port, which is right on the Heilongjiang Bridge. This post has police officers on duty 24 hours a day to ensure the bridge's safe operation. It is the first post from Russia to China, as well as China's ""last line of defense."" ""Our work environment is harsh, but we understand the importance of our duty,"" Liu said.                         "

This ""has happened several times,"" Xiang said.Chinese experts also said that China should continue to improve its own tech capabilities to deal with the possible impact of the US' moves and the effort to draw allies to join its tech war against China.Chinese semiconductor firms are making all-out efforts to achieve breakthroughs in core technologies, in order to boost self-reliance.China's top chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp on Thursday reported record revenue and gross margins for 2022. For the full year of 2022, the company's revenue jumped 33.6 percent from the year before to a record high of $7.27 billion. Meanwhile, the gross margin increased to 38 percent in 2022, also hitting a record high.                         "

""There may be a limited number of imports in the near future,"" the manager told the Global Times on Friday.Another event seen by many foreign media as a possible sign of trade resumption is the recent visit by China's Consul General in Perth, Long Dingbin, to the Western Australian lobster exporter Geraldton Fishermen's Co-op on January 11 under invitation.During the visit, Long said that the relationship between the two countries has shown a stable and positive momentum, and believed that with the joint efforts of all parties, bilateral relations will surely see greater development, according to the official website of the Consulate General.There have been positive signs that have raised expectations for early resumption of the lobster trade, which could take place this month or next month, Fan Xubing, president of Beijing Seabridge Marketing, a seafood importer, told the Global Times on Friday.""But it should be pointed out that the production of Australian lobsters is inferior to that of Canadian lobsters, which are now very popular due to the recovery of consumption in the Chinese market, and they are cheaper,"" Fan said, noting that lobsters from New Zealand, which are similar in quality to Australian ones, are also gaining a greater share of the Chinese market as a good alternative.China issued import suspension orders on beef and timber from Australia in December 2020 after quality hazards were detected. Several tons of Australian lobsters were also reportedly left stranded at Chinese ports in late 2020 due to clearance delays over standard food safety inspection requirements, according to media reports. Other goods such as coal from Australia were also stagnant. In response to a number of foreign media reports about the so-called import restrictions on Australian commodities, Chinese Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian said in early January, using coal trade as an example, that the decision to import Australian coal lies with Chinese companies, not the government.For many Australian goods ranging from coal to wine, the Chinese market had been its main destination due to the strongest consumption capacity, but soured relations combined with other factors have made many Chinese companies and consumers lose confidence and turn away from Australian goods while looking for other more reliable alternatives to reduce the risks of disruption, a trend that was reflected in trade.In 2022, bilateral trade stood at $220.91 billion, down 3.9 percent year-on-year, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs. Australian exports to China fell 13.1 percent year-on-year to reach $142.09 billion last year.While there are growing expectations for improved trade ties with more high-level meetings, a full recovery still requires the Australian side to abandon its Cold War mindset and maintain a pragmatic attitude to serve its own interests rather than act as Washington's pawn, experts said, referring to the recent remarks by the Australian Defense Department regarding the removal of surveillance cameras made by Chinese companies under the pretext of so-called national security.""This surveillance camera melodrama is for the purpose of instigating a social panic about the so-called 'China threat,' to demonize and stigmatize China, with the ultimate aim of thwarting the ongoing improvement of bilateral relations. The Albanese administration apparently needs to bring the damage [to China-Australia relations] under control instead of allowing it to further erode mutual trust,"" Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday.Chen said that since the Labor government took office last May, the freefall in bilateral relations over the past several years has been halted and is expected to be reversed, which is a hard-won success for both Beijing and Canberra. Bilateral economic and trade relations are undergoing a critical restart for the common benefits of both sides, and some forces have been keen on impeding this recovery with their ulterior motives.Canberra needs to cherish what both sides have jointly achieved, Chen further noted, urging the Australian side to inject more momentum into improving bilateral relations rather than catering to anti-China discords.

He said that Chinese investments have covered the region's four provinces and Cambodia will make the region a priority for its economic development.""We also warmly welcome investment from Chinese entrepreneurs,"" said Hun Sen.Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua also said at the forum that China welcomes enterprises to further explore the Chinese market through platforms such as the China International Import Expo, Canton Fair and China-ASEAN Expo.The two sides will create more opportunities for enterprises and investors, Hu noted, adding that 2023 marks the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Cambodia and has also been designated the Year of Cambodia-China Friendship.According to Hu, the two sides have carried out extensive cooperation in textiles, clothing, processing and manufacturing, agriculture and other fields. The Sihanoukville Port Special Economic Zone jointly built by China and Cambodia has attracted 175 global enterprises, providing about 30,000 local jobs.""Priority will be given to resuming and increasing direct flights between China and Cambodia to provide more convenience for exchanges between the two countries,"" said Hu.With the resumption of international travel by Chinese tourists, it is believed that tourism cooperation between the two countries will unleash great potential, Ren Hongbin, chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), said at the Forum.""Today, more than 300 business representatives have gathered in Beijing for in-depth exchanges on bilateral trade, investment and tourism to discuss plans for business cooperation in the new era,"" said Ren.The Friday forum was co-held by the CCPIT, the China Chamber of International Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce of Cambodia and the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.In order to welcome Chinese tourists to Cambodia, the country has conducted industry training and Chinese tour guides and tourism industry service personnel are assessed every year, Cambodia's Tourism Minister Thong Khon said at the forum.Furthermore, Cambodia has encouraged the use and circulation of Chinese yuan and the use of electronic payments.""It is expected that about 4 million travelers will visit Cambodia in 2023, of which 1 million will be Chinese tourists,"" Khon told the Global Times on the sidelines of the forum.""I would like to take the opportunity of this forum to highlight that Cambodia welcomes Chinese investors,"" said Kith Meng, president of the Cambodia Chamber of Commerce.""I believe that with the prime minister's visit to China, there will be more opportunities for more trade and more tourism,"" he said.Meng also said that Chinese companies can take the opportunity to further export to Cambodia and ASEAN countries, which will improve their market share.Chen Ridong, standing vice president of Hubei Representative Office of Cambodia International Chamber of Commerce, said that more Chinese enterprises will invest in Cambodia in 2023, especially those related to the agriculture industry.""Agriculture and tourism are pillar industries of Cambodia. Chinese enterprises and institutions like the Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences have shown willingness to invest in Cambodia, mainly to help increase agricultural technologies,"" Chen told the Global Times on Friday on the sidelines of the China-Cambodia Forum for economy and trade investment and tourism.He also revealed that in November, a technology forum between China and Cambodia will probably be held in Wuhan in Central China's Hubei Province.""To be honest, there are still some concerns about investing in some countries right now because of political factors.

The US Congress's resolution is purely about scoring political points and dramatizing the whole thing. China deplores it and firmly opposes it.""Washington's escalation and expanding of the political implications of the airship incident is a sign that US economic and foreign policy has been completely hijacked by its domestic political chaos, which is having economic consequences not only on the two countries, but also on global industrial chains, experts noted.He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Saturday that the airship incident has given the US yet another excuse to abuse export controls targeting Chinese businesses, and given the US-led ""decoupling"" push, it won't be surprising if more high-tech companies are affected by such restrictions in the future.The past months already saw the US ramp up efforts to strangle China on advanced technology, including a decision to cease approval licenses for US firms to export most items to Chinese technology giant Huawei and coercing the Netherlands and Japan to join the US in limiting exports of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.""Both the US' technological suppression and its escalation of the airship incident actually point to a core problem, that is, the current atmosphere for US-China relations is worrying,"" Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Saturday. ""Some political forces are trying to exploit the tension between China and the US for their own political gain, and this is something to watch out for.""But even in such circumstances, it is still essential for China and the US to manage differences and strengthen communication and cooperation for the sake of a stable bilateral relationship, which is vital to both economies, He said. The US economy is now under broad pressure from inflation, a looming recession and an unfolding debt crisis. A sound economic relationship with China will greatly help alleviate this pressure.While the Biden administration has decided to postpone Blinken's reported trip to Beijing following the airship incident, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen still said that she still hoped to visit China, according to US media reports. And China's Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that China welcomes Yellen to visit China, as it is important for both countries to maintain normal communication.Global Times                         "

In the coming month, consumers will be able to experience tastings and cooking demos at some supermarkets across nine cities to learn more.Statistics from the NSC showed that Chinese consumers are becoming increasingly receptive of Norwegian seafood, and even the epidemic outbreaks last year didn't dampen that consumption enthusiasm. In 2022, Norwegian seafood exports to China exceeded 180,000 tons, up 8 percent year-on-year. The value of seafood exports exceeded 7.25 billion Norwegian kroner ($714 million), up 45 percent year-on-year. China became the eighth-largest market for Norwegian seafood exports in 2022.In 2022, Norwegian Arctic cod exports to China increased 27 percent year-on-year in terms of volume and surged 83 percent in terms of value.""Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing awareness of health and nutrition among Chinese consumers. Also, the trend of home cooking has been increasing,"" said Andreas Thorud, NSC director for the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. ""All these factors have made Norwegian seafood a good choice for Chinese consumers.""The China Imported Seafood Consumption Behavior Report 2022 issued by the NSC reveals that Chinese consumers' main criteria for imported seafood include its texture and taste, nutritional value, safety and quality. In addition, the origin is also an important criterion and Norway is a preferred and trusted origin for seafood.It is not just Norway that hopes to further tap the market in China. Other seafood exporting countries, such as Canada, New Zealand, Chile, and Argentina, have also been actively working with Chinese online and offline companies to explore the domestic market.""From a macro level, with the rapid increase in China's per capita disposable income over the years, China has become recognized as a market with huge potential for high-quality seafood consumption,"" Liu Yi, an industry expert, told the Global Times on Friday. ""And the rapid rebound of the Chinese economy this year is expected to further fuel the growth of seafood imports.""At a micro level, the related industries, such as the fresh food cold chain network and e-commerce platforms are well prepared for imported seafood, but this may also mean that market competition could be fierce in the future, Liu noted.Global Times                         "

The US government's ""decoupling"" approach is undesirable and unrealistic.The Washington's political interference is becoming the biggest threat to disrupting normal economic and trade exchanges between China and the US and harming the interests of US businesses. If such arbitrary investment restrictions that go against the market rules were implemented, US investors investing in China will bear the brunt.There already are severe shocks from the US' ""decoupling"" moves against China in various sectors, and more and more US businesses and scholars have been urging the US government to stop moving further on the wrong track that inflicts more damages.When US President Joe Biden took the office in January 2021, the US business community issued stern warnings about ""decoupling"" from China. If the US and China were to fully ""decouple,"" American businesses would be significantly impacted. If US companies reduce their cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) in China by 50 percent, they will lose $25 billion in capital gains per year, the US Chamber of Commerce warned at the time.But the Biden administration keeps the Trump-era tariffs in place, and even intensifies crackdown on Chinese technology companies.In stark contrast to the US' ""decoupling,"" China will continue to open up and welcome more foreign investors to share the result of its economic growth. It is expected that FDI in China will accelerate growth this year along with a strong economic rebound.For US investors, the Chinese market, especially the promising high-tech industries such as AI, has become a must, rather than just an option. In the case of AI, according to the CSET report, by the end of 2021, China already has more than 1,600 AI companies, making it the second largest market in the world.With the US economy slowing and a possible recession on the horizon, China represents opportunity and profits source for US investors. More importantly, as China further increases investment in scientific research and supports the high-tech field, new advantages will emerge to attract foreign investment. As China's position in the global supply chain is getting more important, more foreign companies have set up their research and development centers in China.Some politicians in Washington are using the so-called national security as an excuse to artificially set up obstacles for American investors to enter the Chinese market. Their disruptions cannot change trends of the market. If American investors have to reduce their investment in China due to government restrictions, they can only hand over the opportunity to competitors from other countries. The US government should jump out of the outdated zero-sum game thinking and stop interfering in normal economic and trade cooperation with geopolitical calculations. ""Decoupling"" cannot curb China's scientific and technological progress and economic development. Instead, it will only make the US lag behind in technological competition.                         "

The purchasing managers' index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector fell 3.3 points to 40.4 in January, logging a seventh straight month of contraction. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in manufacturing activity, while a reading below that level shows contraction.Exports have historically been a major pillar for the island's economy, accounting for more than 60 percent of the region's total GDP. In 2021, when Taiwan island's exports recorded a growth rate of 29.3 percent, with 43.9 percent of the exports going to the Chinese mainland, the island's economy grew by 6.53 percent. In 2022, with its exports to the mainland declining 1.6 percent, the island's exports climbed merely 7.4 percent, leading to an economic growth of 2.43 percent during the year.Therefore, the poor export performance recorded by the island at the beginning of this year has led a number of local research institutes to forecast the region's 2023 growth rate to dip below three percent.Since a large part of the island's trade surplus with the Chinese mainland and the US comes from semiconductors, observers generally believe that due to the US crackdown on mainland companies in the semiconductor sector and the US demand of key technology industries from the Taiwan island to move and build factories in the US, the island's external trade could be undergoing significant structural changes.Meanwhile, the Biden administration has continued to call for advanced technological manufacturing to shift back to the US, particularly when it comes to the semiconductor industry.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, is constructing a $12 billion plant in the US state of Arizona. TSMC also said in December 2022 that it would more than triple its planned investment at its new Arizona plant to $40 billion, making it among the largest foreign investments in US history.Global Times                         "

The US Congress's resolution is about scoring political points and dramatizing the whole case. China deplores it and firmly opposes it.""Washington's escalation and expanding of the political implications of the airship case is a sign that US economic and foreign policy has been completely hijacked by its political machines, which is having economic consequences not only on the two countries, but also on global industrial chains, experts noted.He Weiwen, a former senior trade official and an executive council member of the China Society for World Trade Organization Studies, told the Global Times on Saturday that the airship case has given the US another excuse to abuse export controls targeting Chinese companies, and given the US-led ""decoupling"" push, it won't be surprising if more high-tech firms are affected.The past months already saw the US ramp up efforts to strangle China on advanced technology, including a decision to cease approval licenses for US firms to export most items to Huawei and coercing the Netherlands and Japan to join the US in limiting exports of advanced chip-making equipment to China.""All the things that the Biden administration has done are not conducive but detrimental to bilateral cooperation,"" Li Yong, deputy chairman of the Expert Committee of the China Association of International Trade, told the Global Times on Sunday, noting that the incident disrupted the momentum toward stabilizing bilateral ties since the Bali meeting between the two heads of state. ""Both the US' tech suppression and its escalation of the airship case actually point to a core problem, that is, the current atmosphere for US-China relations is worrying,"" Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Saturday. ""Some political forces are trying to exploit the tensions for their own political gain, and this is something to watch out for.""Experts said it is not surprising that the US uses the balloon case as an excuse to sanction Chinese institutions, entities and individuals, with the aim of accelerating decoupling from China.""It also shows that the Biden administration has become growingly reckless in its strategy to contain China, no matter what the costs,"" Li said, noting that the politicization of the matter by the US government will have repercussions within the US, fueling its racial divide.But even in such circumstances, it is still essential for China and the US to manage differences and strengthen communication for the sake of maintaining a stable relationship, which is vital to both economies, He said. The US economy is now under broad pressure from inflation, a looming recession and an unfolding debt crisis. A sound economic relationship with China will greatly help alleviate the pressure.While the Biden administration has decided to postpone Blinken's reported trip to Beijing following the case, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she still hoped to visit China, according to US media reports. And China's Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday that China welcomes Yellen to visit China, as it is important for both countries to maintain normal communications.                         "

The yelling of ""liar"" and other vulgar terms at the 80-year-old president and the heavy security presence around the Capitol Hill are clear reminders that partisan extremism and political confrontation are becoming deeply rooted in US politics and society, even though two years have passed since Donald Trump supporters' raucous rampage on the Hill.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-12/12eb0e14-1243-4ffc-ba40-c2855680fff2.jpeg," US President Joe Biden delivered his second State of the Union address to a joint session of the US Congress last week, during which he was booed and jeered by the opposition Republican Party lawmakers. The yelling of ""liar"" and other vulgar terms at the 80-year-old president and the heavy security presence around the Capitol Hill are clear reminders that partisan extremism and political confrontation are becoming deeply rooted in US politics and society, even though two years have passed since Donald Trump supporters' raucous rampage on the Hill.Despite Biden's narrative that the politicians in Washington and the broader American public should seek ""unity"" and ""healing"" in his 73-minute speech, the divide and gap are glaringly there for everyone to see - on nearly all issues, including taxation on billionaires and rich Americans, homelessness on the streets, income inequality, medical care and social welfare for the poor, immigration, abortion and same-sex marriage, racial hatred, gun control and police brutality.Biden took the annual ""grand speaking opportunity"" at the US Congress to tout his self-righteousness and personal achievements, emphasizing his administration's deeds in creating jobs and curbing runaway inflation, revitalizing US manufacturing sector, and his government's efforts to repair rundown infrastructure scattered across the country. Although Biden attempted to paint a rosy picture to the American people, many of his ambitious plans, such as bringing back manufacturing and staving off a sharp economic slowdown, are facing enormous difficulties.Wasn't his inconsiderate, blind fiscal splurge of more than $4.7 trillion in 2021 and 2022, coupled with the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing policy of many years, the main cause of a cascade of consumer prices spiral-up and high levels of inflation unseen since 1981? At the same time, America's national debt has now snowballed to a whopping $31.4 trillion, a new record that Biden has to persuade the Republicans-controlled Congress to add more in 2023 by revising the debt limit. If not, the US will face a federal debt defaulting, which will immediately lead to another financial tsunami even more ferocious than the one in 2008.Facing this grave challenge, a possible economic recession, stubborn inflation and depleted savings, the American people have given Biden low marks. According to a latest Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, his public approval rating stands at 41 percent, just better than his predecessor Trump among past US presidents. As many as 62 percent of Americans think Biden has accomplished ""little or nothing"" during his presidency in the last two years. The number is very ominous for Biden's political prospects as the 2024 election cycle draws near and he contemplates a run at re-election. And there will be more challenges for the Biden administration in 2023, as the US under his steering has jettisoned, jolted and fragmented the world, by trampling rough shod over the rules-based international order, erecting barriers of high tariffs and imposing economic and technology sanctions to contain other economies, building divisive political and military cliques, and even waging a proxy war in Europe. As a matter of fact, Biden's emphasis on so-called revitalization of US industries and infrastructure, coupled with technological manipulation, is in essence an updated version of Trump's ""America First"" strategy, prioritizing the US domestic needs over the interests of others and the international community. For example, the two landmark legislations trumpeted by the White House to help rebuild America, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, even fail to take a trifling care of the interest of its European and Asian allies - manifesting the selfish, bare-knuckled attempt by Biden's team to pursue ""America First and Foremost."" And, the two pieces of laws also tell that the US is becoming increasingly anxious, restless and reckless, unsure of its future.During his speech, Biden reiterated that his government doesn't seek conflict with China, and the US will work with the world's second-largest economy and the biggest trader in areas where their interests align. However, he cast the relationship largely as of great-power strategic competition, meaning his administration will continue to play the zero-sum game, and renege on past fruitful cooperation between the two nations.His speech was found to contain a sense of superficial boldness. If China aspires to threaten the US' sovereignty, Biden remarked, the US would act. There were no details as to where that threat might arise since China has never undertaken any action to threaten the US' sovereignty, though recently Biden's team has used the recent case of a single drifting Chinese civilian airship to claim such a threat exists.It seems that Biden's truculently hardline policies toward China are unlikely to be altered over coming months, with his highly divisive and acrimonious economic and technology ""decoupling"" efforts expected to continue, although the unknown end-result of that action might not favor the US. As always, China does not shy away or flinch from a benign competition, though it dislikes vicious containment. For China, it is now imperative to ramp up investment on some selected segments of human resources and ramp up technology innovations in order to achieve tech self-reliance at an earlier date. Year by year, China's massive 1.4-billion and rapidly growing market will prove that only the true economic partners of China will benefit from the country's economic boom and prevail. ""Winning the competition with China should unite all of Americans,"" Biden said in his address, getting to the crux of his preaching. ""For the last few years, our democracy has been threatened, attacked and put at risk,"" he said. But those threats and attacks actually do not come from China or other countries, but from the intensifying feuding within the US' own political landscape, as well as its increasingly polarized society where the so-called ""America Dream"" is rapidly fading and once affluent US households can only make their ends met each day.                          "
Economy,By Yin Yeping  |  2023/2/12 22:26:45,Expectations grow among some Australian firms to resume beef exports to China,"Some Australian beef exporters whose exports to China have been suspended due to quality and other issues are seeking to fully resume trade with China, with some industry players holding talks, the Global Times has learned.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-11-19/088e29bb-7638-4793-9536-4ef62b6aedfe.jpeg," Some Australian beef exporters whose exports to China have been suspended due to quality and other issues are seeking to fully resume trade with China, with some industry players holding talks, the Global Times has learned.Amid gradually improving ties, there are growing expectations for a recovery of bilateral trade, with more interactions expected between industry groups of the two countries in some major traded goods such as beef, an insider said. There could be gains in particular for beef, a key Australian export, despite some uncertainties and variables, a meat industry insider said on Sunday on the condition of anonymity. ""We have been in close talks with an industry representative group,"" the person said, without offering details.In 2020, China suspended beef imports from six Australian beef suppliers due to quality and other issues found in customs inspection.    While the overall beef trade continued, soured bilateral relations due to the previous Australian government's hostile policies against China pushed many Chinese companies and consumers to seek more reliable and trustworthy supplies. Such decisions affected bilateral trade.In 2020, the Chinese mainland imported 253,675 tons of Australian beef, accounting for 12 percent of total beef imports during the period. That was the lowest volume in four years and a decrease of 6.5 percentage points in market share from 2019, according to data from the General Administration of Customs of China.Still, Australia has been one of the major suppliers of beef to China, despite a decrease. In 2022, Australian beef exports to the Chinese mainland dropped 2 percent year-on-year to 175,127 tons, according to Meat & Livestock Australia.Meanwhile, other countries, particularly those in South America, have increasingly become major sources of supplies. Brazil has become the top beef source, accounting for about 40 percent of the total.""The expansion of beef imports from other countries has led to rising competition in the market and the demand for Australian beef, which has no particular advantages in quality and price, is relatively weaker,"" a trader said.The Casino Food Co-op CEO Simon Stahl told the Australian Broadcasting Corp that losing the China market had cost the business millions of dollars.But as demand has boomed and trade ties have improved, there's rising speculation about the possible resumption of beef exports for some Australian producers.Stahl said ""we've even got a customer coming out to see us for the first time since the suspension and since COVID,"" according to the Australian media outlet.Yet an employee of Australian beef producer John Dee Pty Ltd, which was on the suspended list, told the Global Times on Sunday that there has been no news regarding any resumption.Australia is very much looking forward to fully resuming beef imports to China, because the country's production exceeds demand, the export volume is large, and China is a huge market, the senior industry insider said, noting the strong complementarity in trade. China is also ramping up local beef production for its home market while reducing heavy reliance on any single supplier. In 2022, China's domestic beef supply accounted for 73 percent of its overall beef consumption. In the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25), the self-sufficiency rate of beef is expected to reach 85 percent.While domestic output has been growing, demand may also stay strong as consumption in China rebounds faster than expected amid the nation's downgraded epidemic response, industry insiders said.

The two countries resumed diplomatic ties more than one year ago. The senior Chinese diplomat commended the progress made by China and Nicaragua, saying that under the strategic guidance of the leaders of the two countries, cooperation between China and Nicaragua has advanced rapidly, bringing the two countries to the forefront of China-Latin America relations.The resumption of bilateral ties conforms to the trend of history, serves the interests of the two peoples and will open up broader prospects for the all-round development of bilateral relations, said Wang.Ortega said that Nicaragua firmly supports China's efforts to safeguard national security and territorial integrity, and opposes external interference, according to the Xinhua News Agency.Nicaragua supports the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative proposed by China, Ortega added.Since the resumption of diplomatic ties between China and Nicaragua, the two sides have worked together to efficiently promote bilateral cooperation in various fields including trade and the economy, with fruitful and practical results.In July 2022, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Denis Moncada signed the early harvest arrangements for a bilateral FTA via video link. They also announced the beginning of FTA negotiations.""Nicaragua will speed up FTA negotiations with China as the consumption power in the world's second-largest economy will undoubtedly boost Nicaragua's development. During the negotiations, cooperation in the fields of trade and investment, especially in infrastructure construction via the BRI, will expand,"" Zhou Zhiwei, an expert on Latin American studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.In 2022, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, bilateral trade reached $759.6 million, data from China's General Administration of Customs showed.Zhou noted that Nicaragua can further explore China's huge market and expand exports of textiles and agricultural products to China.In addition to Nicaragua, China has accelerated economic cooperation with other Latin American countries based on the principles of equality and reciprocity. China and Ecuador concluded bilateral FTA negotiations at the technical level, which will definitely inject a strong impetus to upgrade the quality of bilateral trade.China's trade structure with Latin America is largely complementary, Zhou noted. ""On the one hand, bilateral cooperation is important for China's energy and food security. On the other hand, if Latin American countries can seize the dividends and opportunities brought by the development of the Chinese economy and further expand the Chinese market, their GDP growth will be very significant.""  More importantly, China's ability to invest and its openness to international cooperation, with full respect for each other's sovereignty, is a very desirable form of cooperation for Latin American countries, Zhou said.In a recent exclusive interview with the Global Times, Ambassador of Ecuador to China Carlos Larrea said that China does not impose any conditions on countries with which it cooperates, and this is the cornerstone of a relationship of great friendship, respect and trust.

Such an unparalleled feat does not just happen, especially during a tumultuous period in the global geo-economic landscape and a tough phase in China's economic transformation and upgrading process. It was Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era that guided the country in overcoming various risks and challenges, and in keeping the China economic miracle alive. As China embarked on the quest to become a great modern socialist country amid global changes unseen in a century, Xi's economic thought has been and will continue to be the guiding principle for development in China for years to come, and have great significance for the world. What is Xi's economic thought? What does it mean for China and the world? To answer these questions, the Global Times has launched this special coverage on Xi's major economic speeches and policies and how they are put into practice to boost development in China and around the world.When President Xi Jinping visited Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Southwest China's Sichuan Province in February 2018, the region, home to the largest ethnic Yi community, was still engaged in a tough battle against extreme poverty. Due to its harsh natural conditions and rough terrain, Liangshan, about 2,000 kilometers from Beijing, has long struggled with grinding poverty. Liangshan was declared to be one of the three most severely impoverished prefectures in the national battle against poverty. About three years later, in February, 2021, Xi announced that China had scored a ""complete victory"" in its fight against poverty, noting that absolute poverty had been eradicated in the world's most populous country - a miracle that will ""go down in history.""After years of national and local efforts, Liangshan also witnessed the eradication of absolute poverty, with more than 1.05 million people lifted out of absolute poverty and 11 counties and 2,072 villages removed from the list of impoverished areas.In the report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in October 2022, Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, underscored the ""central task"" of the Party, calling for efforts to advance the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts ""through a Chinese path to modernization."" And Liangshan, along with the entire country, has embarked on a path to achieving Chinese modernization with sweeping efforts in a wide range of areas from infrastructure building and economic development to environmental protection.Liangshan's transformation over the years - from being one of the country's most impoverished areas to a key region in the country's modernization efforts - is a microcosm of China's efforts and achievements in exploring the Chinese path to modernization, which has become a historical task for the CPC. Likewise, in the course of the national battle against absolute poverty, such efforts and achievements in remote, less-developed areas like Liangshan are crucial in China's pursuit of achieving modernization with uniquely Chinese characteristics. While addressing the opening of a study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance) on February 7, Xi stressed the importance of correctly understanding and vigorously advancing Chinese modernization, noting that the modernization process of a country needs to follow the general rule of modernization, but it shall be suited to its realities and characterized by features unique to its context, according to Xinhua.Chinese modernization is characterized by five features that are unique to the Chinese context - the modernization of a huge population, of common prosperity for all, of material and cultural-ethical advancement, of harmony between humanity and nature, and of peaceful development, according to Xinhua.  Such features require national efforts in a wide range of areas, including building modern infrastructure that supports sustainable economic and social development. For remote areas like Liangshan, the common Chinese saying that in order to get rich, one must first build roads aptly describes its efforts in pursuing Chinese modernization. In that regard, major progress has been made. On December 26, 2022, a high-speed railway line linking Chengdu, the provincial capital of Sichuan, and Kunming, Southwest China's Yunnan Province, which also runs through Liangshan, became fully operational. On the day, with a brand new Fuxing bullet train, a new notch in the proverbial belt of the country's world-leading high-speed train technology, departing Chengdu for Xichang, a county-level city in Liangshan, the prefecture known for its dilapidated roads  entered into the era of high-speed rail. The new high-speed railway is of great significance to Liangshan's local social and economic development, as it further links the prefecture to other advanced regions and helps foster local tourism and other industries, said Shen Xiang, a local official in Liangshan. The railway cuts travel time between Chengdu and Xichang from 11 to 3 hours. ""I can now leave in the morning and arrive in Chengdu or Kunming and start working at noon, and [return to Xichang] conveniently in the afternoon,"" Shen told the Global Times, noting that the railway has helped adjust Liangshan's development to give full play to its advantages in coordinated regional development. One of Liangshan's advantages is its rich hydropower resources, which are of national significance. Six days before the Fuxing bulletin train arrived in Xichang for its inaugural commercial operation, on December 20, 2022, the Baihetan hydropower station, the world's second-largest in terms of total installed capacity, part of which is located in Ningnan County, Liangshan, became fully operational.With a total installed capacity of 16 million kilowatts, the Baihetan hydropower station is crucial in China's clean energy drive toward sustainable development. Baihetan's operation marked the completion of the world's largest clean energy corridor, where six mega hydropower stations on the Yangtze River transmit electricity from the resource-rich west to energy-consuming regions in the east. For Liangshan, the power station means more job opportunities, more income, and faster social and economic development, according to Shen. In the pursuit of Chinese modernization, better infrastructure is crucial, said Wang Yiwei, Jean Monnet chair professor and director of international affairs at the Renmin University of China. ""Better infrastructure has laid the foundation for industrial development, which has in turn brought prosperity and improved standards of living. Without these better roads, many products from remote areas would not be able to reach markets all over the world,"" Wang told the Global Times.China has been making great strides in building modern infrastructure and shifting to clean energy. For example, at the end of 2022, the length of China's operational railways exceeded 155,000 km, including 42,000 km of high-speed railway lines alone, and it plans to build more than 3,000 kilometers of railways in 2023, including 2,500 km of high-speed lines. Also, China has become a world leader in renewable energy expansion, with renewables expected to account for 36 percent of electricity consumption by 2025, according to some estimates. As the five features of Chinese modernization indicate, comprehensive development in areas such as economy, culture, and urbanization is also key. In Liangshan, after years of poverty alleviation efforts, villages that were once ""too far away"" from ""modernization"" without electricity or running water have transformed and many villagers have been relocated to ""modern"" communities with modern facilities and amenities, said Ake Jiushe, a local official and award-winning author of books on Liangshan's poverty alleviation work.""[Liangshan] took a giant thousand-year leap in just a few decades,"" as it emerged from thousands of years of isolation and became highly connected to the outside world, from backwardness to modernity and from poverty to moderate prosperity, Ake told the Global Times. Beyond modern infrastructure, once impoverished counties in Liangshan like Zhaojue are also seeing continuous improvements in cultural services, with more and more cultural facilities and events being made available, according to Ake. Liangshan has also become nationally known for its traditional Yi culture, with its colorful costumes and exotic events like the Torch Festival and folk music, attracting many tourists from Sichuan and across China. During this year's Spring Festival holidays, for example, Liangshan saw more than 3 million visitors, up 39.37 percent year-on-year, and 2.4 billion yuan in tourism revenue, up 107.82 percent year-on-year, according to local official data. It is the nationwide efforts under the firm leadership of the CPC that have lifted millions of people in Liangshan and across the country out of poverty, and the CPC's leadership, with Xi at the helm, also provides guarantees that the pursuit of Chinese modernization will be successful, despite various challenges and risks, experts said.Unique conditions in China's vast rural areas like Liangshan as well as the country's unique history and governing system, among other factors, mean that Chinese modernization is different from the Western style of modernization currently prevailing in the world, though there are also commonalities. While giving his speech on February 7, Xi said Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presenting another picture of modernization, and expanding the channels through which developing countries can achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, according to Xinhua.  ""There are many commonalities with Western modernization… at the same time, there are clear differences. For instance, Western culture promotes individualism and egoism, while in China altruism is more highly valued. Western countries' modernization unfolded in tandem with their colonization of other countries, whereas China's modernization is being achieved through peaceful development and win-win outcomes,"" Wang said. Western modernization, especially modernization dominated by the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism, has led to a dichotomy of modernity vs. backwardness through which the West views nations, whereas Chinese modernization is transforming the story of modernization by shedding a light on a new form of human advancement, according to Wang. Yury Tavrovsky, head of the ""Russian Dream-Chinese Dream"" analytic center of the Izborsk Club, said that Chinese modernization has become an open challenge to the liberal-capitalist model.""In a few decades, China has traveled on a path that took Western countries centuries to complete,"" Tavrovsky told the Global Times, noting China is striving for greater efficiency than that provided by the capitalist model, while maintaining justice in society. In his speech, Xi also said innovation must be prominently placed in overall national development, and efforts must be made to achieve higher efficiency than can be found in capitalism while maintaining fairness in society more effectively.Although the Chinese path offers nations a new option for the pursuit of modernization, ""China does not call on other nations to follow its development strategy as an exact model, but rather, like China, seek a development path that suits their own national conditions,"" Wang said. Meanwhile, for China, ""the cause of promoting Chinese modernization, which is an unprecedented and pioneering venture, will inevitably encounter all kinds of risks, challenges, difficulties, and even dangerous storms, some of which we can foresee and others we cannot,"" Xi said. ""Let us harness our indomitable fighting spirit to open new horizons for our cause.""Such a cause, for Chinese people across the country, including in Liangshan, means a better life. ""If we keep advancing along the road of Chinese-style modernization, the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in Liangshan will be better,"" said Ake.

The two countries resumed diplomatic ties more than one year ago. Wang noted that since the resumption of diplomatic relations, bilateral economic and trade cooperation has reaped fruitful results under the leadership of the two leaders. 2022 saw the establishment of an inter-governmental mechanism for economic and trade cooperation, the signing of the early harvest arrangements for a bilateral FTA as well as the launch of negotiations on a comprehensive FTA. Nicaragua made its debut at the 5th China International Import Expo (CIIE), which has enhanced the visibility of its local products in the Chinese market. Moreover, China's imports from Nicaragua increased by 43.7 percent year-on-year, fully demonstrating the dividends of the resumption of diplomatic relations, Wang said.Wang noted that the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to promote Chinese-style modernization, which will bring huge market opportunities to Nicaragua. As this year marks the 10th anniversary of the China-proposed BRI, China's Ministry of Commerce is willing to work with Nicaragua to promote the high-quality construction of BRI, and make every effort to advance the negotiation and signing of FTA, in order to transform complementary advantages into comprehensive cooperation momentum, and promote bilateral economic and trade relations to a new level.Laureano said that Nicaragua attaches great importance to the FTA negotiations, hoping that both sides will speed up to promote the early harvest arrangements of the FTA to enter into force as soon as possible and reach a high-quality comprehensive agreement at an early date. Nicaragua is willing to work with China to actively implement the consensus of the two heads of state, continuously improve the level of bilateral economic and trade cooperation, and jointly build a community with a shared future. The advisor added that Nicaragua is willing to actively participate in various exhibitions hosted by China, such as the CIIE, to further expand the scale of bilateral imports and exports.

Its investment is likely to reach 100 billion yuan ($14.66 billion).A total of 152 new-energy projects involving 29 provinces and regions are underway or at preparatory stage. The projects cover clean energy bases in the country's north, offshore wind farm in the east and integrated bases of hydropower and wind farm in the southwest, plus scattered projects in the central and eastern regions. Huaneng signed contracts with 13 other SOEs in January, bringing them into its new-energy intelligent operation and maintenance platform.A total of 494 projects were signed in early February in Shenyang, capital of Northeast China's Liaoning Province, with those related to new energy and energy conservation accounting for 27.8 percent.Bidding to build offshore wind farms has become active. Since the beginning of February, relevant agencies have announced winning bids for the procurement of wind turbines for a large new energy project in the port of Huizhou, South China's Guangdong Province. Those deals have activated both the upstream and downstream segments of the renewable energy industrial chain, with prices of polysilicon, silicon wafers, cells and other raw materials in the photovoltaic sector all increasing.And, projects operational rate is ticking up, amid expectations that demand will be gradually released after the Spring Festival holidays, according to an analysis by Essence International.China's large SOEs are committed to leading the country's new energy transition, and they are the largest investors in the sector, and their active bidding bodes well for project construction in 2023, said Fitch Ratings.Also, many local governments have set eyes on developing clean energy, deemed as a driving force for driving local economic growth as the nation has vowed to achieve the ""dual carbon"" goals on time.Renewable energy development is a focus of many local governments' annual work reports. East China's Shandong Province proposed a target of renewable energy installation capacity to reach 80 million kilowatts this year. North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, one of the country's largest coal producers, pledged to fast track renewable energy projects.""The region will grasp this historic opportunity brought by renewable energy development, by speeding up construction of whole industrial chain in an attempt to build a new 'Industrial Inner Mongolia' ,"" Chen Zheng, the deputy head of the region's energy department, said on February 7.The region has made continuous progress during recent years in promoting green transition by giving priority to the construction of large solar and wind energy bases. By 2025, the installed capacity for renewable energy generation in the region will exceed coal-fired power, according to the action plan. During the next four decades, the proportion of wind power, photovoltaic and other renewable energy generation in China is expected to exceed 65-70 percent, as the country unswervingly pushes forward the green transition, said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University.""Since the installed capacity of renewable energy represented by wind power and photovoltaic projects will usher in explosive growth in the medium and long term, we should actively promote the construction of large new energy bases in the northwest,"" Lin said.China saw steady growth in renewable energy capacity in 2022, data from the National Energy Administration (NEA) showed. As of the end of last year, the installed capacity of renewable energy hit 1.21 billion kilowatts, accounting for 47.3 percent of the total installed power generation capacity, surpassing coal.In 2022, China generated 2.7 trillion kilowatts of electricity from renewable energy sources, which accounted for 31.6 percent of total electricity consumption, equivalent to the entire power consumption of the EU in 2021, according to the NEA data.                          "

Meanwhile, 56 BSE-listed companies are involved, including Beijing Northland Biotechnology Co, Sino IC Technology Co and BTR New Material Group Co, according to media reports.Through margin lending, investors can load up on cheap debt to buy stocks so as to enlarge their profits when they expect stock prices to rise, whereas securities lending is important for short selling, in which investors borrow securities to immediately sell them and they buy them back at a lower price, according to industry insiders.""Margin trading and securities lending transactions have been conducted on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges for 12 years and have achieved good results.

The bourse halved the commissions it charges for stock trading to 0.025 percent of the transaction value from December.As of February 10, a total of 169 companies were listed at the Beijing bourse, with a combined market value of 240 billion yuan ($35.36 billion).""As an important part of the country's multi-dimensional capital markets, there will be great potential and remarkable policy dividends for the development of the BSE,"" said Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co.The exchange is set to play a larger role in supporting the development of the new economy, according to Yang.China recently unveiled draft rules for the rollout of the registration-based IPO system across the domestic stock market, a major leap forward in the reform of one of the world's biggest capital markets. The system is expected to help new economy firms obtain financing from the capital market, and enhance the role of the capital market in promoting high-quality development and economic structural transformation.Dong said the BSE should make greater reforms in accelerating capacity expansion by allowing the transfer of more firms from the National Equities Exchange and Quotations, also known as the ""new third board.""On Monday, the BSE 50 rose by 1.55 percent to 1,052.22. So far this year, the index has risen by 11.69 percent.Along with sound stock performances, large volumes of foreign capital continue to flow into the A-share markets. In January, the amount of northbound capital reached a single-month record high of 141.2 billion yuan. Yang projected that more than 300 billion yuan worth of foreign capital inflows can be expected for the whole year of 2023, as Chinese stock markets are more attractive globally thanks to the swift economic recovery.

If approved, it would be Warburg Pincus' second equity buy in a Chinese mutual fund company, underlining a profound interest by foreign financial institutions in China's mutual funds.Aside from equity buys, in less than three months, a total of four mutual fund companies have become wholly owned by foreign financial institutions, through the setting up of new subsidiaries or a reshuffle of those in charge of the organizations, according to industry site chinafund.com. The change has outweighed what's been accomplished in the last two years, the report said.The category of wholly foreign-owned mutual funds in China welcomed a new member on February 3 - famed Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley as China speeds up approving overseas financial institutions to swim in China's $3.9 trillion asset management market.The company's asset management unit Morgan Stanley Investment Management announced that it has received approval from China's securities watchdog CSRC for Morgan Stanley Investment Management to take full ownership of a China mutual fund venture, according to a statement published on the company's official WeChat account on February 6.According to the statement, Morgan Stanley Investment Management has increased its stake in Morgan Stanley Huaxin Funds from 49 percent to 100 percent, which the company said marks ""breakthrough"" progress in its strategic map in the Chinese market.The announcement came just two weeks after JP Morgan, another well-known US financial services company, won a nod from the CSRC to buy out its China mutual fund venture.With the regulatory approval, Morgan Stanley has become the seventh overseas global asset manager that wholly owns a mutual fund management firm in China, joining others like BlackRock and Schroders.Gokul Laroia, CEO for Asia at Morgan Stanley, said the company sees long-term opportunities in China's assets management industry with high levels of wealth creation, growing demand for financial advice, and the launch of a private pension scheme in the country. Dan Simkowitz, head of Investment Management at Morgan Stanley, added that the company will provide more diversified services for China's assets and wealth management market, and the Chinese market will also become an important pillar of the company's global investment management business growth.Experts said that overseas asset companies are elbowing their way into China's huge and increasingly burgeoning mutual fund market, which offers a shot at profitability regardless of stock price fluctuations.According to a report by the Securities Daily, a total of 1,520 mutual funds were issued in China in 2022, raising capital totaling 1.48 trillion yuan ($218 billion), almost half of what was raised in 2021.""The number or capital raising amount of domestic mutual funds will see a rising trend in the long run because a growing number of people are expected to invest in the domestic securities market,"" Xi Junyang, a professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Yang Delong, chief economist at Shenzhen-based First Seafront Fund Management Co, said that dropping mutual fund issuance in 2022 was mainly a result of the impact of the coronavirus disease, which dragged down stock performance.However, as stock markets are expected to rise again with a predicted economic recovery in 2023, mutual fund issuance is likely to ""explode"" again and become an important source of incremental capital in the securities market. ""China's mutual fund market has entered a period of rapid development. As the trend forms for domestic residents to shift capital from deposits into investment channels and as the real estate market's investment chances increase, China's mutual fund market will witness plenty of opportunities over the next few years,"" he told the Global Times.However, Xi said that the speed of approval for global companies' entrance is a little slow in general since regulators scrapped foreign ownership restrictions in the industry in April 2022, although it has sped up a little in recent months as China moved to optimize coronavirus disease management measures.""It's a matter of two-way selection. On the one hand, Chinese regulators are focusing on introducing overseas financial institutions with relatively robust and advanced management experience. On the other hand, overseas institutions also have concerns about whether they can issue funds smoothly in China, as the market is full of competition currently,"" Xi noted.Previously, the regulator also approved Schroders, Fidelity International, and Neuberger Berman Group to set up wholly-owned new fund units.Apart from mutual fund firms, overseas companies are also mounting efforts to set up wholly-owned companies in other financial sectors. On February 3, Standard Chartered said it had been granted approval by the CSRC to set up a mainland securities firm, according to a statement sent by the company to the Global Times that day.In the statement, the company said it was the first time that the CSRC has granted the establishment of a securities firm wholly owned by a foreign shareholder since ownership restrictions were scrapped three years ago.The securities firm, headquartered in Beijing, would have an initial capital injection of 1.05 billion yuan and would cover businesses including asset management, underwriting, securities brokerage, and other activities.Zhang Xiaolei, president of Standard Chartered Bank (China), said that with the sustained and accelerated opening-up of China's capital market at a high level, the company wants to provide more financial solutions for domestic and foreign companies/institutions that come in or out of China for investment.Meanwhile, Munich-headquartered Allianz has also been approved by Chinese regulators to become the mainland's first wholly-owned foreign insurer.According to Xi, the gradual approval of setting up financial institutions wholly owned by overseas capital is a natural result and is required for China's financial opening up.""Introducing overseas institutions can create benign competition for domestic companies. In particular, domestic companies can learn from multinational financial firms in terms of their business mechanism via business contact or cooperation,"" Xi said.He added that rising risk control abilities of domestic banks following the setup of foreign banks in China are a good example of how domestic financial institutions can learn from overseas financial multinationals.On the other hand, overseas companies might clash with domestic partners in setting up joint ventures, particularly in terms of internal management, and setting up wholly owned firms provides them more leeway to tap mainland markets, Xi said.

Last week, the number of cases dropped a massive 92.21 percent from the peak of the outbreak late last year, and the rate of positive detection of the virus via nucleic acid testing continued to decline.Global Times                          "

Additional storage capacity of 1 trillion cubic meters is basically in place, according to Sichuan local media outlet Scol.com.The well was drilled by a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) in July 2021. The original design depth of the well was 7,990 meters. In order to further explore the oil and gas properties in the deep stratum, the drilling depth was eventually increased to 9,026 meters.Industry insiders call it an ""underground Mount Qomolangma,"" also known as Mount Everest.""The depth is a record for the deepest vertical well in Asia, which provides a strong engineering and technical guarantee for ultra-deep oil and gas exploration in China,"" Ma Yong, a deputy director of the Engineering Technology Department at CNPC Southwest Oil & Gasfield Co, said.The geological conditions of the well are complicated, and they pass through more than 10 different strata. The drilling faced challenges such as extreme depths, temperatures, pressure levels and sulfur content.For instance, the minimum drilling hole diameter of the Pengshen-6 well is 15 centimeters. At a depth of more than 9,000 meters, such a small drilling space is a great test for the precision control of drilling.Ma said that the drilling of the Pengshen-6 well has laid a good foundation for the 10,000-meter-deep exploration well to be implemented in 2023.In the practice of oil and gas exploration and development, strata buried more than 8,000 meters belong to the super-deep category. Since 2011, CNPC has completed eight super-deep wells with depths surpassing 8,000 meters and two ultra-deep wells over 9,000 meters in the Sichuan Basin. Global Times                         "

With the resumption of Chinese flights to Thailand, Airports of Thailand expects about 7 to 10 million Chinese tourists to land at Bangkok's airports in 2023, Lvmama, a domestic online travel agency, told the Global Times.Industry insiders expect another boom in outbound travel during the holidays, and companies are preparing. Xu said that the industry is getting more confidence due to growing demand for the May Day holidays, based on positive feedback from the first batch of outbound group tours. ""The number of tourists for CYTS Tours in the coming two to three weeks will likely increase by seven to 10 times compared with the first week starting on February 6.""Zhang expected more young and working tourists to catch up on outbound travel during the May Day holidays, while their destinations will be those offering safety and those that are friendly to Chinese travelers with a rich history or with great natural beauty.The May Days holidays will see an explosion in overseas travel by Chinese tourists. ""Our company has started to prepare products for the holidays and summer vacations, including expanding the diversity of products, adding staff and launching more online and on-site promotions,"" Wang He, CEO of Fly Elephant, told the Global Times on Monday. Major Chinese airlines are managing to restore international routes. China Eastern Airlines expects to resume 60 international and regional routes with 410 flights, while Hainan Airlines will resume flights from Haikou in South China's Hainan Province to Bangkok in Thailand, per statements sent to the Global Times by the airlines. Authorities in various countries hope to attract more Chinese tourists.

Should that prediction materialize, the robust growth in the Chinese economy will likely ""raise South Korea's economic growth by an additional 0.16 percentage point and its exports by 0.55 percentage point this year,"" South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Sunday, citing the report.The news came after South Korea's economy saw its first quarterly contraction since the second quarter of 2020 when the outbreak of the pandemic roiled the economy. Bank of Korea data showed that real GDP, adjusted for inflation, fell by 0.4 percent in the final quarter of 2022, compared with the previous quarter. In January, South Korea logged its biggest monthly trade deficit ever, at $12.7 billion, as exports of computer chips and other high-tech items sank, the Associated Press (AP) reported. South Korea's semiconductors export to China, its largest trade partner, almost halved in January, according to media reports, partly impacted by the escalating US chip war against China. At a time when South Korea's economy is losing momentum, some South Korean people are pinning hope on China's economic recovery. But this is no time for optimism. It should be pointed out that some data have suggested things are going in the opposite direction of what people expected.  It is understandable that South Korea doesn't want to annoy US over its ""decoupling"" push, especially in strategic areas, such as semiconductors, but with the economical interdependency between China and South Korea, that will be difficult to achieve. South Korea may want to strike a balance amid geopolitical wrestling, but its economic woe and export decline remind Seoul that it should take a more courageous step to protect its export markets and improve economic relations with China, its largest trading partner. It is the only way South Korea can maximize the benefits of China's ongoing economic rise achieved after the country optimized its COVID-19 strategy.However, there is a worrying phenomenon: reports that Chinese citizens said they faced unfair treatment at an airport after entering South Korea rattled the market. On January 2, the South Korean government halted short-term visas for people traveling from China, and temporarily stopped the plan of increasing flights from China. The measures taken by South Korea are regrettable. In the early days of China resuming overseas group tours, South Korea was not committed to enhancing economic ties with China and attracting Chinese tourists, but made a big fuss about its entry restriction policy and implementation, which inevitably makes people doubt whether it is a political show.No matter how South Korean economists said they expected positive growth given China's reopening, they cannot deny that South Korea has lost in the first round of competition to attract Chinese tourists, and has missed the economic growth opportunities brought by tourism recovery after China resumed overseas group tours for Chinese citizens. South Korea said Friday it would resume issuing short-term visas to travelers from China, ending a COVID-linked restriction that sparked tit-for-tat measures from Beijing. After the announcement, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said China will consider resuming issuance of short-term visas for South Korean citizens when appropriate. ""It is hoped that South Korea will work with China to do more to facilitate normal people-to-people exchange between the two countries,"" Mao said.A resumption of short-term visas should become a new starting point for South Korea to exploit the potential of China's ongoing economic recovery. If South Korea loses in the first round of the competition, hopefully it can catch up in the second round, and whether South Korea wins or loses depends on Seoul's wisdom.                         "

As the epidemic eased and tax breaks for vehicle purchases were extended, production and sales improved, He said, and the trend will persist this year.In 2023, China's car sales are expected to return to the level of 2017, which is estimated to be at least 28 million units, bolstered by strong exports, especially when it comes to new-energy vehicles, according to the China Automobile Dealers Association.China's shipbuilding industry will remain stable. Factors such as the aging of existing ships, the pressure of new environmental regulations, the reshaping of global trade routes caused by geopolitics and the increase in demand, will drive up demand for shipbuilding steel, He said.Moreover, the rapid development of domestic multimodal transport, road-to-rail transportation and the development of China-Europe freight trains will support the demand this year for containers, another steel-consuming sector, He noted.Furthermore, the real estate market, the largest steel consumption industry, is experiencing a positive trend amid policy support this year.Other related businesses will also stay strong, such as the sales of home appliances, driven by pent-up demand and stimulus packages such as coupons provided by local governments and companies.Due to global high inflation, prices for bulk commodities, including raw materials for steel making, have stayed high, posing challenges to the world's economic recovery.China's resilient demand for steel is expected to inject new impetus into the economic recovery in the country and also around the world. The World Steel Association has predicted that global steel consumption in 2023 will be 1.814 billion tons, of which China alone will take about half.In January, the new order index for domestic steel industry was 43.9, an increase of 5 points from the previous month, according to the China iron and steel industry purchasing managers' index, released by the CFLP Steel Logistics Professional Committee, indicating that steel demand remained stable and rebounded.Booming domestic steel consumption may lead to strong imports of iron ore and coking coal from countries including Australia, Wang Guoqing, research director at the Beijing Lange Steel Information Research Center, told the Global Times on Monday.Australia has remained the largest exporter of iron ore to China - a total of 729.32 million tons of Australian iron ore were imported in 2022, up 5.1 percent year-on-year, taking around 66 percent of total iron ore imports. Brazil held a 20.5 percent share, ranking second.The diversification and expansion of coking coal supplies may help further stabilize domestic steel prices and downstream players improve their profit margins, experts said.The first batch of Australian coking coal, an essential input for iron and steel, arrived at South China's Zhanjiang on February 8, with more ships to come.Wang said these factors combined signal trade growth between China and Australia, and ""with the gradual resumption of Australian coal trade and the domestic consumption rebound, market supply and demand will be better balanced.""                          "
Economy,By Wen Sheng  |  2023/2/13 21:51:21,Support policies boosting recovery in China's vital property sector,"China's property sales and housing construction are expected to pick up considerable momentum throughout 2023, inspired by the central government's steady policy support since late 2022. The sector has been struggling for some time, with various large developers mired in debt, and the three-year-long COVID-19 pandemic made things worse to some extent. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-13/369dbb00-7054-4c47-a51a-e6afec6ddec6.jpeg," China's property sales and housing construction are expected to pick up considerable momentum throughout 2023, inspired by the central government's steady policy support since late 2022. The sector has been struggling for some time, with various large developers mired in debt, and the three-year-long COVID-19 pandemic made things worse to some extent. The urban property sector accounts for nearly 40 percent of Chinese bank lending and 50 percent of the local governments' yearly revenues, so it is imperative for the country to strengthen housing construction and trade, industry insiders and economists say.The government's ever-widening policy support since November last year should help China's property developers restore health to their balance sheets and revitalize stalled or distressed housing projects. The country's property sales plunged by 26.7 percent year-on-year in 2022, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics, and property sector investment fell 10.01 percent - the first yearly decline since records began in 1999. The People's Bank of China, the central bank, and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission in November promulgated a 21-point plan to improve the balance sheets of the country's high-quality property developers, including greater access to credit for developers and funding to ensure prompt delivery of new homes. These measures are expected to reinvigorate the property sector. In December, the regulators announced a massive 250 billion yuan of expanded bond financing for housing developers. In addition, the government rolled out a 100-billion-yuan loan support plan to boost rental housing supply in Chinese cities.The new package of housing market revival measures includes instructing state-owned commercial banks to substantially ramp up lending to the real estate sector, while offering effective financing to enable stronger real estate developers to acquire unfinished housing projects from weaker ones, like the financially battered China Evergrande Group.The new supportive measures also allow housing developers to extend loans and bonds due in the coming six months by as long as 12 months, and privately owned developers will get the same treatment as state-owned enterprises. Developers will also be able to buy more land to expand their business.However, the recovery of the industry also depends on other factors, such as average income levels of Chinese workers. Incessant salary raises are able to shore up the sector's healthy growth.China will strive to generate more demand over the coming three to six months to address the slump in real estate investment and construction, Vice-Premier Liu He said in a keynote speech at the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland in January. He underscored the importance of shoring up the real estate industry and protecting indebted developers, as the sector accounts for up to one-fifth of the country's annual GDP. Thanks to the 2020-2022 deleveraging drive in China, housing bubbles have been largely swept away, leaving more room for the sector's revival in 2023.However, the regulatory deleveraging has also produced some undesirable side-effects, with a number of property developers suffering liquidity shortages and deteriorating balance sheets. ""The risks are noticeable for a handful of leading property developers. If this is not handled properly, risks in the housing sector may grow and trigger systemic risks. That is why prompt steps should be taken,"" Liu said.To spur growth in the real estate sector, more preferential policies are being developed and promulgated. Last week, Wuhan, China's eighth-most populous city, moved to ease a key restriction on housing purchases by allowing local households to buy an additional home in the city. The move is expected to be followed by other Chinese cities to prop up property sales.House buying will serve as a key economic stabilizer for all Chinese provinces in 2023, economists say, as a good number of tier-1 and tier-2 cities are including promotion of housing consumption in their development plans. From the start of the second quarter this year, a significant recovery of the real estate market will be apparent, industry insiders say.South China's Guangdong Province, with a local GDP of more than $1.86 trillion, voiced support for housing consumption in January, with plans for differentiated mortgage policies and favorable tax rates for owner-occupied homes. Shanghai, the country's most developed industrial city, vowed to strengthen market demand for homes and to meet the reasonable financing requirements of property developers to ensure stable and healthy development of the city's economy. And northeastern Liaoning Province said it will encourage housing consumption by providing equal subsidies and support to buyers of both new homes and second-hand homes.Along with the constant optimization of the government's preferential policies that aim to boost the virtuous cycle and healthy development of the real estate sector, indexes for property investment and housing sales have both improved. All the positive developments will likely support a soft landing for the property market, once again making the sector an important contributor to economic growth this year and beyond.

Although the CPI rose by 6.5 percent year-on-year in December 2022, the sixth consecutive month of cooling inflation, now an increasing number of analysts forecast that the optimistic expectation of continued decline in US inflation is facing challenges.Consensus indicates headline US inflation will push 0.5 percent higher in January, spurred on by higher energy prices, unwinding months of deceleration. Excluding food and energy prices, so-called core inflation is forecast to rise 0.4 percent for the month, The Australian Financial Review reported on Monday.Analysts observed that US inflation likely rose in January, in part due to higher prices of home, second-hand cars and energy. In addition, in a wage-price spiral, the rapid wage growth in the US labor market also causes the costs of businesses to increase, pushing up inflation expectation in the US.This week's US consumer price and retail sales data is likely to determine the near-term level of the asset price. If there is a U-shaped turn in US inflation, it may force the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in the contradicted position of taming inflation and preventing recession again. To bring down the inflation, the Fed may be forced to keep interest rates high.This week's inflation data may be a trigger for the decline in US stocks. The rise in US stocks this year is due to the market's belief that the Fed is tending to be dovish. If this assumption does not exist, that is, after this week's inflation data, the Fed will be aggressive in raising interest rates, US stocks may fall.Markets have already sharply raised the profile for future tightening by the Fed, with rates now seen peaking up around 5.15 percent as a result of Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes. Asian shares slid and the dollar rose on Monday as investors hunkered down for US inflation data that could jolt the outlook for interest rates globally, Reuters reported.Rising US interest rates could derail the US economy's struggling recovery and exacerbate the risk of a recession. US businesses reported a further decline in activity in January, according to The Wall Street Journal. On average, business and academic economists polled by The Wall Street Journal put the probability of a recession in the next 12 months at 61 percent. The Fed initially hoped to raise interest rates to push inflation down at the cost of a slowdown in economic growth, and the potential risk of the Fed being forced to continue raising interest rates amid high recession risks is worrisome.The great uncertainty in the US economy and its policy is causing great impacts on world economy. The performance of other developed economies in 2023 remains to be seen, and the export of inflation in the US may worsen inflation in Europe and the world, thereby exacerbating their economic difficulties.As status high energy prices, declining household purchasing power, weakening external environment and tightening financing conditions continue into 2023, the European economic outlook is facing great uncertainty this year. Japan and South Korea, the developed economies in East Asia, have been impacted by the interest rate hike of the US dollar, and their economic development is also subject to great uncertainty.The global economy is in a critical stage of recovery and still faces great uncertainties. Therefore, countries should strengthen coordination and cooperation to jointly deal with potential challenges, so as to eliminate risks to the greatest extent and ensure economic recovery. In particular, when the US implements new economic and financial policies, it should not pass on the crisis, but take full account of its spillover impact and adopt a more responsible approach to other global economies.

Stimulated by the double benefits of the Spring Festival holidays and China's optimized COVID-19 prevention and control policies, the province has seen a sharp rise in tourism recently. During the holidays, the province received 11.54 million domestic tourists, a 23.61 percent increase year-on-year. Among them, 18.1 percent were tourists from other provinces, who accounted for 68.9 percent of tourism consumption.The city of Jilin, nicknamed ""the capital of rime and a paradise for skiing,"" received a total of 1.98 million tourists, generating 2.259 billion yuan ($332 million) in income. According to data, Jilin's most famous Beidahu Ski Resort and Vanke Songhua Lake Ski Resort received a total of 92,800 visitors during the 2023 Spring Festival holidays, up 4.74 percent year-on-year, and realized a tourism revenue of 60.57 million yuan, up 10.68 percent year on year.Jin Yongshan, secretary of the Party Committee of the Jilin City Ice and Snow Economy High Quality Development Pilot Zone, told the Global Times that the Beidahu Ski Resort, which became the largest single ski resort in Asia in 2022, saw a 16-fold increase in hotel reservations around the holidays compared with that in 2019.""We used to ski in Beijing but now Jilin's winter sports industry is getting better and better. And as our country downgrades the epidemic control policies, this [Jilin Province] has become our favorite tourist and sports destination,"" a 27-year-old woman surnamed Chen told the Global Times.The growth in the number of people participating in ice and snow sports has also directly driven the sales of ice and snow sports-related goods.

Also, the employment scale of farmers should be set at above 30 million this year. One of the measures is to further implement the monitoring and supporting mechanism in a more precise and targeted way, Liu said, while urging rural areas to develop new growth drivers and industries to create more employment opportunities for rural laborers.In 2022, the annual per capita disposable income of farmers surpassed the milestone of 20,000 yuan ($2,935) for the first time to reach 20,133 yuan, up 4.2 percent year-on-year, Chinese officials said. Global Times                         "

''This is another major milestone for our China franchise, one we remain very committed to,"" Benjamin Hung, CEO for Asia of Standard Chartered, was quoted as saying.Thanks to increasingly stable economic growth, the relatively sound fundamentals of Chinese leading companies and factors like slowing interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve, China International Capital Corp projected in a note that net flows of foreign capital into the A-share market may reach about 300-400 billion yuan in 2023, according to media reports.Global Times                         "

It is also the 20th consecutive year that China's central authorities have issued the first policy statement on agricultural and rural work. Tang Renjian, director of the Central Rural Work Leading Group Office and minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, said at a press conference in Beijing on Tuesday that the key policy priorities of the document could be summarized in three aspects - ""securing the bottom line, bolstering rural revitalization efforts and reinforcing support.""""Securing the bottom line is intended to ensure national food security and forestall any large-scale re-emergence of poverty,"" Tang said, while highlighting the goal of achieving grain output of more than 650 million tons this year and pushing production to a new level of 700 million tons.According to Tang, China will stabilize its planting area while striving to increase grain production. For example, authorities will encourage southern regions to develop grain varieties that yield more than one crop per year, and implement projects to increase yields of soybeans and corn. China will also expand the planting of edible oil crops such as soybeans, steadily push forward corn-soybean strip intercropping and develop saline land for planting soybeans.""China has the potential to achieve grain output of 700 million tons this year. Planting conditions are favorable, disruption from the pandemic has ebbed, and the prices of agricultural materials have dropped. So it is necessary to maintain the momentum with more muscular support,"" Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday. In 2022, China's grain output reached 650 million tons for the eighth year in a row, providing a better, stronger and more stable source of rice for 1.4 billion Chinese people despite global uncertainties, Tang said. Production of soybeans, a crop for which China is heavily reliant on imports, reached a new high last year, exceeding the milestone of 20 million tons.Also, China moved to solidify the results of poverty reduction in 2022 - a key year that saw deepened integration between poverty relief and rural revitalization - ""with a better foundation and more sustainable results,"" Liu Huanxin, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group for Rural Affairs and Director of the National Rural Revitalization Administration, told the Global Times on Tuesday.According to Liu, the consolidation of the results of poverty reduction - a foundation for carrying out rural revitalization - was manifested in three aspects: no large-scale backsliding to poverty, which was helped by a monitoring and support mechanism, as well as stable employment and rising incomes among rural workers who have been lifted out of poverty.In 2022, a total of 32.78 million migrant workers enjoyed full employment, which was 2.59 million people above the annual target. The country's yearly per capita disposable income of farmers in areas just emerging from poverty grew 7.5 percent last year to 15,111 yuan, which was 1.2 percentage points higher than the national average for farmers. China will work harder to reduce poverty through helping poor workers secure jobs, Tang said, noting that the country will make sure that more than 30 million people who have shaken off poverty will be employed.Li suggested that rural authorities to establish a more comprehensive mechanism to diversify and shore up farmers' income, in case of a resurgence of poverty in rural areas where the agricultural product structure is too simple and vulnerable to overcome market fluctuation.At the press briefing, officials expounded on the connotation of ""strong agricultural country,"" a grand goal set for the first time in the annual policy document, which observers said would buttress the building of a Chinese path of modernization with a longer vision. ""Building a strong agricultural nation has rich meanings. On the one hand, it needs to incorporate the common traits presented by developed countries. On the other hand, it should take account of Chinese characteristics, including a large population with relatively little arable land, the farming civilization deeply rooted in Chinese history, and the harmonious coexistence between man and nature,"" Tang said. He said that the factors that determine the path of agricultural modernization with Chinese characteristics should be ""holding rice bowls firmly by ourselves, developing ecological low-carbon agriculture, and steadily pushing forward common prosperity.""

Upon completion, it is expected to become the world's largest and most accurate omnidirectional radio telescope, which can carry out scientific research in the frontier fields of Nanohertz gravitational waves, fast radio bursts, black holes, dark matter, celestial bodies and the origin of life, providing strong technical support for future space activities in China.It is believed the installation will represent another major breakthrough in the country's development in astronomy following the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), Science and Technology Daily reported.Another science event to look for next year in search for physics beyond the limits of current understanding is the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory in southern China, using a detector located 700 meters underground to precisely measure the oscillation of neutrinos — electrically neutral subatomic particles.Neutrinos are the ""hermits"" in the world of elementary particles, known as ""ghost particles."" With small masses and no electricity, they pass through the human body and the Earth and hardly interact with any matter.The mass order of neutrinos is the basis for the study of neutrino and the evolution of the universe, and is also the core issue in international neutrino research, according to media reports.Other fields including Moon landings, mRNA vaccines and climate finance are among the developments set to shape research in the coming year, according to Nature's list.Global Times                         "

Seven of those projects are currently in development and four of those teams could deliver their experiments to the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) for launch during 2023.Headman said that ""it [the China Space Station] is there and it will be open to international projects and researchers. It is truly international in that sense…therefore it is an amazing achievement for China's national space program but also internationally.""""It is an absolutely fantastic opportunity for researchers around the world to use the China Space Station,"" he said. The Global Times previously reported that the CMSA and the UN Committee on Peaceful Use of Outer Space (COPUOS) announced in June 2019 that these nine international projects in aerospace medicine, life sciences and biotechnology, microgravity physics and combustion science, astronomy and other emerging technologies are from 17 countries and 23 research bodies, including Polar-2, a Gamma-ray burst polarimetry project jointly proposed by Switzerland, Poland, Germany and China, and a spectroscopic investigation of nebular gas by India and Russia. Projects from Italy, Japan, Peru, Mexico and Saudi Arabia were also selected as the first batch of China Space Station awardees under the UNOOSA cooperation project going by the Access to Space for All, the UN office official website shows. Chinese space observers said that compared with the highly exclusive cooperative mechanism of the International Space Station (ISS), the China Space Station adopts true openness under a UN framework.For the ISS - a partnership among NASA, Russia, Canada, the European Space Agency and Japan that has been in orbit for more than two decades - laboratory resources are split among the partner nations, which then offer their scientists opportunities to send experiments to the space station. However scientists living in countries that are outside of the partnership are generally shut out of the ISS, the New York Times reported on December 4.China's Space Station is the first of its kind to be open to all UN member states. Let us hope that greater success is still to come for China's manned space program and that China's space station will soon become a ""home in space"" for all, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a routine press conference on November 1.China sends only fair and sincere invitations to the rest of the world to come on board its space station, especially for those developing countries that fail to meet the high threshold yet have great space development ambitions. China cares and hopes that experiments of these countries will yield breakthroughs in terms of livelihood improvement in sectors such as communications and agriculture, Wang Ya'nan, chief editor of Beijing-based Aerospace Knowledge magazine, told the Global Times on Sunday. The world may be challenged by uncertainties and great turbulence caused by political games staged by the US to force countries to take a side in the camp confrontation, but eventually China's true openness and inclusiveness will prevail in space cooperation, Wang predicted. Wang speculated that although the US-led project failed to make it to the first batch of international projects on the China Space Station, the door of future cooperation is still open. ""It is a result of scientific consideration, rather than a political decision in the sense that the US has closed the way to invite China to the ISS cooperation.""Apart from the genuine openness, the technology advantages of the newer China Space Station also greatly attract researchers from around the world, Sun Jianchao, the technology manager with the Chinese team of the POLAR-2, told the Global Times on Sunday.The China Space Station has a high-volume and high-speed data transmission capability and a powerful in-orbit computing capability provided by the supercomputer on the space station, which facilitates space experiments, Sun explained. During the primary stage of the selection work, 42 applications were received from scientists of 27 countries and regions in Asia, Europe and North and South America. Seventy-two international cooperation teams and 258 research fellows submitted applications.Sun recalled that it took the four-nation applicants about one year to attain the approval to come on board in 2019. The POLAR-2 experiment is expected to be sent to the China Space Station by around 2025, via the Tianzhou cargo spacecraft. It will be then installed outside the cabin of the Wentian lab module with the help of taikonauts and the smart robotic arms, according to Sun.Data will be shared among project participants in an undifferentiated manner, Sun said.                          "

The medical personnel confirmed that the taikonauts were in good health, marking a complete success of the return mission, the Global Times has learned from the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) on Sunday. The Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft successfully separated with the China Space Station combination at 11:01 am Sunday. Before their departure, the Shenzhou-14 crew, with the help of a local ground team, completed the handover with the Shenzhou-15 crew, and other tasks including downloading the experiment data, the CMSA said earlier. “It marked the first return mission after the completion of China Space Station’s T-shape basic structure assembly, the first after gathering of six taikonauts at the space station, and also a first that has taken place in the winter night at the Dongfeng site,” Peng Huakang, the person-in-charge of the manned spacecraft recovery team with the spacecraft developer China Academy of Spacecraft Technology (CAST,) told the Global Times.The return of the Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft consisted of five stages before the final touchdown, including the separation of spacecraft from the space station, the braking maneuver, the re-entry to atmosphere and decelerating before landing. Adopting a rapid return strategy similar to previous missions, the Shenzhou-14 craft rounded Earth only five times before making its re-entry. Then the orbiter capsule separated with the return capsule. And with the help of the propelling capsule in two braking maneuvers, the combination of the return capsule and propelling capsule then descended from 400-kilometer orbit to 100-kilometer one before their separation, the CAST explained in a statement provided to the Global Times.The propelling capsule was burnt up during re-entry to the atmosphere and the return capsule took on a well-calculated trajectory to be headed back to Earth’s atmosphere and to the Dongfeng site.Besides personal items, the ""luggage"" carried by the three taikonauts back also includes a batch of medical science experiment samples, mainly body fluid and cytology samples, which can allow the ground research team to better understand the changes inside human body during their life in space, the Global Times learned from the CMSA.According to Li Yinghui, a researcher with the Chinese astronaut training system, the ""luggage"" includes astronauts' blood, urine, and saliva. Researchers can study human adaptability to the environment with in-depth, at the level of cells, molecules, and genes, which enables China to have its own genetic resource bank for environmental adaptation in orbit.Search and rescue work for the Shenzhou-14 return capsule is of great significance in boosting China’s international image, as the task marks the conclusion to the construction stage of the China Space Station, Bian Hancheng, the deputy chief designer of the manned space project landing site system, told the Global Times. China has signed agreements with more than a dozen countries and regions to carry out space experiment projects on the China Space Station, and this is the first time that space application system has participated in the search and rescue works at Dongfeng, according to Bian, who is also a senior engineer with the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in Northwest China’s Gansu Province. The task has opened a new normal for the landing site to recover space application payload from domestic and foreign customers, he said.The biggest challenges facing the search and rescue mission s extreme cold and night conditions that could lead to most complicated and difficult situations, according to the Dongfeng landing site authorities. Bian explained that it is more difficult to identify and locate the target craft at night than during daytime and it is also extra hard to arrive at the landing site, as landing a helicopter would be more difficult given the poor visibility of surroundings during the night time in remote Gobi Desert. Dubbed the China Space Station’s busiest crew to date, Shenzhou-14 mission commander Chen Dong and his fellow crewmembers Liu Yang and Cai Xuzhe conducted three extravehicular activities or known as the spacewalks, delivered a new episode of the Tiangong Classroom space lecture sessions, carried out multiple space experiment and application projects, and above all, participated and witnessed the completion of the China Space Station’s three-module T-shape basic structure assembly.They also greeted the incoming Shenzhou-15 crew on Wednesday, handing over the key to the China Space Station to the Shenzhou-15 taikonauts on Saturday, in addition to completing the country’s first-ever in-orbit work handover. Moreover, Chen Dong the mission’s commander also became the first taikonaut to have worked and lived in orbit for more than 200 days during the Shenzhou-14 mission that lasted more 183 days.

China announced that its manned rocket for the mission is expected to be constructed by 2030, while NASA has pushed back its moon landing to 2025 or later. Nelson's unsubstantiated accusations fully reflect that the US lacks confidence in its aviation development, experts told the Global Times.Nelson's renewed hype of the Chinese aviation threat theory is actually a common NASA trope, spinning an external excuse to spur the US Congress to pass more related budgets, Song Zhongping, a space analyst and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday.""China has never said it aims to engage in a so-called space race with the US,"" he said, noting that the past race with the Soviet Union and Cold War mindset trapped the US.In fact, publicly attacking China’s space programs has become normal for NASA in the past few months. In September, Nelson accused China of lacking needed transparency over issues. In July, the NASA chief blatantly claimed that China is “trying to occupy the moon.” In May, he said that China stole the US’ space technology. ""These accusations fired by NASA are unfounded and unjustified,"" Song said. ""China has always had a cooperative and open attitude in the space sector.""In the 1990s, China launched satellites for other countries and provided space delivery services to other countries. Now, with its space station, return satellites and target vehicles, China has also been providing piggyback services and giving platforms to other countries’ projects.China issued an action statement in November outlining its plan for promoting further international cooperation on space technology and exploration, working with other countries and international organizations within the framework of the United Nations. Observers point out that China’s space station is facing all countries in the world that are willing to cooperate, including developing countries, which is the real sense of an international space station. On the contrary, the space station created by the US is precisely a club for the rich, and it is very difficult for developing countries to get their hands on it.In 2011, the US Congress passed the Wolf Amendment, a law that prohibits NASA to engage in cooperation with China and China-affiliated organizations. “Now that China has moved into the top echelon of space-faring nations with its own innovations, the US is starting to worry even more,” Song said. “The country realizes that China's momentum is going to be strong and even limitless, which needed to be contained.”Such a narrow US mindset and approach would not only be unhelpful to the two countries' technological development, but also could even overshadow the progress of human technology, analysts said.If the US could treat China as a partner and not as an enemy, it would promote the humankind's ability to explore space to soar, Song noted.

They have been participants in a number of China's achievements in space including the first-ever visit to the far side of the moon and the close-up visual capture of an asteroid. The Global Times talked with the young team to find out about the stories behind these great achievements. Aged less than 35 years old on average, the members of the team are in charge of key command, design and operating positions in the tasks of flight control and spacecraft management in China's manned space projects, as well as lunar and planetary exploration missions.In the past decade, the young team has been involved in 17 major manned space spaceflight missions, four lunar probes and the country's first Mars exploration. More than 80 percent of the team are graduates from leading universities in China, and most of them have masters and PhD degrees. They share the same trait of having the mindset of always pursuing innovation, and are motivated by the firm will to explore the vast universe. They are also determined and inspired by the goals of constantly boosting China's capabilities of conducting space activities and expanding the boundaries. Yu Tianyi, a deputy director of the scientific research planning office of the Beijing Aerospace Flight Control Center, is part of the young team.Yu and his team have achieved multiple key technological breakthroughs in remote operating for the country's lunar rovers. Yu was the ""driver"" for the country's Yutu-2 lunar rover and he managed to steer the rover onto the surface of the far side of the moon.Yu's team also formulated the planning and controlling system for the Yutu-2 rover's remote operation, extending the rover's service life, and making it constantly renew the world record for the longest survival time on the lunar surface.The China National Space Administration revealed that as of January 21, Yutu-2 has been operational for more than 4 years and has trekked nearly 1,500 meters on the lunar surface. China has provided more than 940 gigabytes of data to the world collected by the rover. Yu told the Global Times that the Chang'e-4 lunar mission and the construction of the China Space Station were the most challenging moments in his career. ""As our Chang'e-4 lunar probe and Yutu-2 rover are going to new places, we are facing great uncertainties such as the landing site environment,"" Yu said.Yu likened the China Space Station to a ""giant transformer"" in space, saying that such a complicated spacecraft demands perfection at every stage, which makes it difficult work for his team. Bao Shuo, another member of the team who was born in the 1990s, is the flight control center's first chief dispatcher. After the Chang'e-5 probe landed on the lunar surface in December 2020, Bao was in charge of organizing all units for the key sample collecting work.Bao set the fastest earth-digging record on the moon's surface at just 37 minutes, as well as the record for sample collecting and sealing work, which was completed seven hours ahead of schedule. ""I love beauty and fashion but I also like the beauty of chasing the space dream,"" Bao said. The team has worked in solidarity, achieving multiple international firsts including the world's first Lunar Lagrangian L2 point relay and detection, and a Mars mission that involved orbiting, landing and roving. They have filled in more than 50 blank spaces of space technology for China and the world. They have also shown the world the hard-working spirit of Chinese youth during the space missions. Yu told the Global Times that it is hard to pick the most difficult moment, as the team felt it was on thin ice during each orbital launch, and each return of a manned spacecraft.""Maybe the public are witnessing the normal process of missions stage after stage. In fact, behind each operation, we are standing by with numerous back-up plans in case of emergency,"" Yu explained.Around 4 am on October 18, 2016, the flight control center was operating missions for the Shenzhou-11 manned spaceflight mission to the Tiangong-2 space lab. All of a sudden, the center's computer detected a red alert for a potential collision with debris in space when the manned spacecraft was in its 14th lap after entering orbit, and less than 24 hours before its rendezvous and docking with the Tiangong-2.Two taikonauts on the Shenzhou-11, Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, were close to crashing into the space debris if the flight control team had not stepped in. By 4:30 am, the team had come up with four sets of strategies to avoid a collision. After analysis by the expert panel, they decided to jump start the remote guidance control process ahead of the original schedule. According to the avoidance strategies, the orbit control team re-designed three orbit altering plans in 20 minutes. By 8:59 am, a group of control direction and data was sent out. About 30 minutes later, the Shenzhou-11 spacecraft managed to change its orbit smoothly. The red alert was then successfully cleared and later the spacecraft made a successful rendezvous and docking with the Tiangong-2.The Beijing center has staged a number of successful space rescues in recent years, including the rescue of the Yutu-2 rover as well as controlling the China Space Station to avoid colliding with space debris. Outlining new exciting chapters in major projects such as deep space exploration and manned space programs, the long-anticipated fifth edition of the China Space white paper, titled China's Space Program: A 2021 Perspective, was released at the State Council Information Office in Beijing in January 2022. It disclosed that China will, in the next five years, launch the Chang'e-6 lunar probe to collect and bring back samples from the polar regions of the moon. Chang'e-7 will perform a precise landing in the moon's polar regions and complete research and development for Chang'e-8 key technology.Asteroid probes will also be launched to sample near-earth asteroids and to probe main-belt comets and complete key technological research on Mars. Exploration of the Jupiter system and boundary exploration of the solar system are also on the list of things to do for China's space industry in the next five years.Gao Yuhui, a senior engineer with the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, said that he will next make plans for the country's Phase-4 lunar probe missions and manned moon landing missions. Gao adopted for the first time AI-powered planning technology to effectively solve the severe constraints faced by flight control tasks and flight control planning in complex lunar environments.With the rapid development of China's aerospace industry, future space exploration will inevitably face more complex spacecraft systems and mission requirements. Research into safer, more reliable, more intelligent and efficient planning strategies and technical methods is an urgent task for the world's space powers, he said.The team will also strive to make breakthroughs in the fields of intelligent planning and system engineering, Gao said.

The Chang'e-7 mission is intended to land on the moon's south pole and conduct detailed surveys to explore for traces of water, according to the program's chief designer. The Chang'e-8 mission, which is expected to be launched around 2028, together with the Chang'e-7 mission will complete the building of the ILRS basic structure, and there would be a lunar orbiter, lander and rover as well as a range of scientific detection devices, Wu said. Sources familiar with the development of the lunar exploration program told the Global Times on Monday that the Chang'e 6 probe is a backup to its predecessor, Chang'e 5, which managed to return 1,731 grams of lunar samples and marked the first lunar-return mission since 1976, so it is capable of collecting and bringing samples back to Earth.Wang Qiong, a deputy chief designer of the Chang'e-6 mission, disclosed that the Chang'e-6 will be launched in 2024 or 2025.To prepare for the mission, the Queqiao-2 relay satellite will be launched by the beginning of 2024.Sources also explained that the selection of the south pole as Chang'e 7's destination was based on two major considerations. One is that it may provide a sustained solar power supply due to its favorable solar illumination conditions, as opposed to extreme heat and cold during the lunar day and night in other regions, and relatively stable temperatures that will allow for long-term robotic exploration and future manned activities at the ILRS. Another reason for the selection is water, as the permanently shadowed craters in the polar region could harbor reservoirs of ice and other volatile compounds that will be valuable resources for manned explorations.China began its lunar program in 2004 and has launched five robotic probes since 2007. The fourth, Chang'e 4, landed on the far side of the moon in January 2019, becoming the first spacecraft to closely observe the little-known lunar region. Its rover, named Yutu 2, has been working there for more than four years as the longest-operating lunar rover.The basic structure of the ILRS will be built by around 2028, so it will be possible for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon within 10 years, according to Wu Weiren in November 2022.Developers are concluding the research stage for the country's next-generation manned launch vehicle with new technological breakthroughs, and the launcher is moving to the prototype development stage, according to the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp (CASC).The next-generation manned rocket is designed and developed in accordance with Chinese manned space authorities' overall plan, and it is commissioned to launch China's next-generation manned spacecraft or the moon surface lander, with an emphasis on high reliability and high safety, the state-owned space giant revealed. ""It is expected to reach maiden flight conditions by 2027,"" the CASC said.

This is America in 2023,"" CNN cited data from the Gun Violence Archive as saying that 39 mass shootings have taken place across the country in just the first three weeks of 2023.The New York Times revealed that in the first few weeks of 2023, at least 69 people have been killed in mass shootings across the country, including two shootings within days of each other in California.And the number of such shootings appears to be rising in the first few weeks of this year, compared with similar periods in recent years, according to the Gun Violence Archive data.A study published late last year in JAMA Network Open which analyzed firearm deaths over the past three decades revealed a total of more than 1 million lives lost since 1990, according to a CNN report.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the number of mass shootings in 2023 is unprecedented in the history of the US, which again exposed the deep-rooted social and systematic problem in the country.The frequency of mass shootings and the variety of places in which they now take place contributes to the sense, prevalent across America, that such violence could break out at any moment, anywhere, NYT noted.The shooting cases fuel calls for gun control, said Li, noting that Congress is likely to allow for a high level debate about the way guns are regulated or restricted.However, the potential debate, like previous ones, would never solve the problem, the observer said. ""Shootings, mounting public indignation, debates, shootings again...a vicious spiral exposed serious problems in the US' governance,"" Li pointed out.                         "
Diplomacy,By Global Times  |  2023/1/19 21:35:22,China urges Japan to stop irresponsible plan of dumping nuclear-contaminated water amid wide criticism,"China's Foreign Ministry urged Japan to stop its irresponsible plan to force the dump of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, after the Japanese government announced last week that the discharge of Fukushima water would start around this spring or summer, sparking widespread criticism both at home and abroad.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-07-17/45a691af-e617-4102-8e8c-93f824f947ce.jpeg," China's Foreign Ministry urged Japan to stop its irresponsible plan to force the dump of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea, after the Japanese government announced last week that the discharge of Fukushima water would start around this spring or summer, sparking widespread criticism both at home and abroad.The Japanese government gave an estimate for when the water from the crippled Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant will be released into the sea, saying at a cabinet meeting held on January 13 that it could happen sometime ""around this spring or summer."" In April 2021, the government approved the release of more than 1 million tonnes of irradiated water from the site after treatment into the ocean. The move was met with criticism from home and abroad. Organizations in Japan and people from many countries have spoken out against Tokyo for breaking its promise and expressing strong opposition to the decision.Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a regular press briefing on Thursday that the marine environment concerns the interests of the international community as a whole, and the discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water is not a matter for Japan to decide alone. The Japanese government has pushed ahead with the plan despite widespread concerns and strong doubts expressed at home and abroad, Wang said, pointing out that such a self-serving move will certainly trigger dissatisfaction and criticism from all walks of life.Expressing his concern over the upcoming dump of the nuclear-contaminated water, the spokesperson cited a number of comments from experts and environmentalists in the international community.The head of the Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies pointed out that the Japanese government's unilateral push to dump the water runs counter to international environmental laws and regulations.The head of the Korea Federation for Environmental Movements, a South Korean nongovernmental environmental organization, said that the release of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea will set a very negative precedent if it goes ahead.The lead researcher of the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology of Russian Academy of Sciences noted that the nuclear-contaminated water slated for release into the sea contains a large amount of radioactive material that cannot be thoroughly filtered through existing technology, and poses serious harm. It is particularly regrettable that the Japanese government and the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) have gone back on promises that they would not dispose of the water without the understanding of relevant parties.Secretary General Henry Puna of Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) said that the Japanese government had pledged to maintain communication with Pacific Island countries on the disposal of the nuclear-contaminated water and to provide all independent and verifiable scientific evidence on the issue. However, the Japanese government went against its promise to not go ahead with the discharge without Pacific leaders' approval.""Our region is steadfast that there be no discharge until all parties verify it is safe,"" Puna said on Wednesday at a livestreamed public meeting in Suva, Fiji.According to media reports last week, Puna has indicated that Japan could lose its status as a Pacific Islands Forum Dialogue Partner over the lack of information on the dumping plan.Wang said, ""We urge Japan to respect the legitimate concerns and strong voice of the domestic people and the international community, honor its commitment, earnestly dispose of nuclear-contaminated water in a scientific, open, transparent and safe manner, and stop the irresponsible act of forcing the release of nuclear-contaminated water into the sea.""Japan's dumping of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean will have influence on the ocean environment, security of food and people's health, and Japan made such unilateral decision without having full negotiation with neighboring countries or international organizations, which is irresponsible and immoral, Li Song, Chinese ambassador for disarmament affairs, said in August, 2022 at the Tenth Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, expressing strong concerns over the related issues.Japan's unilateral decision to dump Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean is made purely out of concerns for its own economic cost, and it has neither resorted to all possible ways to handle it, nor had full negotiations with neighboring countries. Such selfish move is to transfer the risk to the international community. People in Japan, China, South Korea, Russia and Pacific island countries all expressed their concerns, Li said. Global Times                         "

Poland, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Finland are among the list. In total, Ukraine's European allies would send about 80 tank vehicles to the frontline, Politico reported on Wednesday night.The move worsened the already complex situation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.At a press briefing in Moscow on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed Western countries of sending tanks to Ukraine, saying that there are no prospects for the resumption of Russia-Ukraine peace talks. Peskov noted that if Abrams tanks are delivered to Ukraine, they ""will burn like all other tanks,"" but as they are expensive, the European taxpayers will bear the financial burden while ""Americans, as always, will remain at least with their own, and most likely - with good profits.""Chinese analysts noted that even though it is not sure if the Ukrainian troops could handle the advanced aggressive weapons provided by its Western allies, the current situation is ""not positive.""Analysts warn that the actions of Western countries further interfering in the conflict will intensify and even lead the current Russia-Ukraine conflict to reach an ""unimaginable level of confrontation.""From defensive arms to aggressive tanks, the West has gradually increased its military assistance to Ukraine. However, questions remain about how the tanks will help Ukrainian troops and influence the course of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, analysts noted.""Now the conflict between Ukraine and Russia is mainly on land, so the main performance on the battlefield depends mainly on the quality and capability of weapons and soldiers. At present, Ukraine is obviously in a passive role,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday.""Russia has strong land combat capabilities, while the US and Germany want to improve Ukraine's military capabilities by providing main battle tanks to Ukraine,"" he said. ""These land warfare weapons will undoubtedly enhance Ukraine's military strength, but on the battlefield, many factors will play a role, including military strategic deployment and the quality of soldiers.""An anonymous military source observed that ""Ukraine is using weapons and equipment temporarily supported by various countries and may face problems of insufficient personnel training and insufficient logistical support.""The M1 Abrams' ""complex electronic components and especially their gas turbine propulsion systems"" could make them particularly difficult to operate and maintain, according to The Warzone, a defense-analysis website. ""In other words, the US can't just send its M1s to Ukraine,"" the website said.Moreover, the tanks provided by the US and Germany are all heavy-duty main battle tanks, which operate fine in winter. But in spring and summer when the roads become muddy, the tanks' performance would be affected, the military analyst said. ""By contrast, Russia's T72 and T90 tanks, which are lighter, have stronger mobility.""""At this stage, the supply of weapons (air defense systems, heavy tanks, small and medium-range missiles) will help the Ukrainian army to hold the front and prolong the conflict, increasing the losses on both sides,"" Sergey Biryukov, a professor at the Siberian Institute of Management in Novosibirsk of Russia, told the Global Times on Thursday.However, Biryukov believed that tanks provided by the US and NATO countries are ""still insufficient for the spring offensive"" for Ukraine.At the same time, the provision of long-range missiles and combat aircraft manufactured by NATO countries to Ukraine may contribute to a significant escalation of the situation; nevertheless, I believe that such a delivery is unlikely to take place in the near future, Biryukov said.Russia's bottom lines are constantly being breached. There is something terrifying about cornering a nuclear power, analysts noted.After Biden and Scholz's announcement, the responses from Russia and the analyses of military and international relations experts suggested that the tanks will lead to a further counterattack against Russia, making the end of the conflict more unpredictable.Russia's ambassador to Germany Sergey Nechaev condemned Germany's decision to send tanks to support Ukrainian defenses, saying it is ""extremely dangerous"" and will push the war to a ""new level of confrontation.""Russia's Ambassador to the US Anatoly Antonov said on Wednesday that any delivery of American tanks to Ukraine would be seen as ""another blatant provocation"" by the West.""If the US decide to supply tanks, it will be impossible to justify such step using arguments about 'defensive weapons,'"" the envoy said. ""This would be another blatant provocation against the Russian Federation.""On Thursday, Russia fired dozens of missiles toward Ukraine. Ukrainian military spokesman Yuriy Ignat said that ""We expect more than 30 missiles, which have already started to appear in various territories. Air defense systems are operational,"" AFP reported.""The escalation of the conflict can be ensured by the West supplying Ukraine with long-range missiles and combat aircraft in significant quantities, as well as the deployment of NATO military infrastructure in Ukraine without the official involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance in the conflict,"" Professor Biryukov said, adding that Poland or Romania, as the ""juniors"" of NATO, joining the conflict officially may also trigger the escalation.At the same time, it should be recognized that the line between escalation and the ""normal"" course of the military conflict in Ukraine is quite thin and conditional, he said.Biryukov believes that only a serious military conflict in another region of the world, a sharp increase in the economic crisis in Western countries, or the large-scale destabilization of the existing political regime in Ukraine due to internal factors, may distract the US and NATO from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and ease the current tension.""Reaching a strategic agreement between Russia and Western countries on de-escalation and ending the conflict seems unlikely today,"" he noted.Li Haidong said that ""all in all, the US intended to use Ukraine to consume Russia, and finally reach the goal to permanently isolate Russia from Europe. ""Although this goal is difficult to achieve, the US and its Western allies will sacrifice Ukraine, but never at the expense of their own.""                         "

Claiming the US' one-China policy ""antiquated,"" the resolution urged US departments to work toward recognizing Taiwan island's status in international organizations. One of the 18 sponsors is  In another provocation, McCarthy is reportedly set to visit Taiwan island some time  this year, likely in spring. The Pentagon is preparing for the trip regarding security logistics, Punchbowl News, a Washington-based political news daily, cited an anonymous official as saying. Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies and a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, believes that if McCarthy makes the visit, which is highly likely, China's response against the US would be of higher intensity than that after then house speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to Taiwan island in August 2022. Besides China announcing sanctions against Pelosi and her immediate family, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) in August held joint drills in the Taiwan Straits which were of unprecedented scale and duration, forming a blockade of the island. China has drawn a clear-cut red line, but if the US regards it as not clear enough and keeps testing the line, ""we don't mind reinforcing it,"" Lü told the Global Times on Friday.  The August drills demonstrated the PLA's capabilities of seizing air superiority and control of the sea, and an escalation of response could be a larger-scale engagement of PLA naval and air forces, or more training courses, such as amphibious landing operations, military analysts said. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, cited a Chinese saying that ""quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes."" The US keeps hollowing out its political commitment by passing bills, selling weapons and making provocative visits to the island of Taiwan. Its provocations keep piling up in quantities, which will lead to a qualitative change - China has to address the Taiwan question once for all, Song told the Global Times on Friday. Behind the highly provocative statements of the resolution is the Republican-controlled House acting extraordinarily radically in playing the ""Taiwan card,"" observers said. The two US parties have little common agenda, yet the ""China threat"" and the Taiwan question are part of the limited common language the two parties share to keep the US political vehicle functioning. Lü pointed out the US' dangerous provocations over the Taiwan question are a spillover of its chaotic, out-of-control internal politics. Republicans will keep making trouble in the House to thwart the Biden administration's attempts to manage the US relations with China. However, there are quite a number of US politicians who allow personal and party interests to override US interests, continuously poison China-US relations and create minefields for the relationship, Lü said. Those US moves cast a shadow over US Secretary of , over which Song holds low expectations for a positive outcome. Amid the US' continuous provocations, Blinken's visit could be nothing more than a diplomatic contact between the two major countries, Song said. Communication is better than conflict, but communication would be pointless if Blinken, who is supposed to ease bilateral tension, just comes to repeat the US' coercive methods. Lü said that how China-US relations will develop in the near future depends largely on whether the Biden administration will create room for discussions on pragmatic issues or whether it sticks to an agenda of irreconcilable conflicts. ""China's resolve to defend its territorial integrity and security never wavers.""                          "

Since the implementation of the NSL in Hong Kong, the HKSAR has taken on a new political atmosphere of peace, shown vigorous economic vitality and returned to a stable and peaceful social situation. Hong Kong's position as an international financial, shipping and trading center has been further consolidated. It continues to rank at the top on the global indices for rule of law, security and business environment. The confidence in Hong Kong's development prospects from international capitals continues to grow. The facts eloquently proved that the enactment and implementation of the NSL are entirely in line with the reality of Hong Kong and have played a decisive role in realizing Hong Kong's transition from chaos to governance and further toward prosperity. The spokesperson pointed out that the US has turned a blind eye to the fact that Hong Kong is stable, united and thriving and runs counter to the mainstream public opinion in Hong Kong which expects stability, security and advancement. The real intention of deliberately extending the implementation period of the so-called Hong Kong-related memorandum is to manipulate visa policy to provide ""safe haven"" for fugitives who oppose China and destabilize Hong Kong, exposing the sinister intention of US' expectation for chaos in Hong Kong. The spokesperson noted that the US used the so-called memorandum to smear the NSL and played up the ""consequences"" of Hong Kong's NSL. The fact is that since the implementation of the NSL, only 230 people have been arrested by the HKSAR police on suspicion of endangering national security, among whom more than 30 completed trial procedures and were found guilty by the court. The US' gimmickry to put Hong Kong in disorder cannot incite the clear-sighted Hong Kong citizens, cannot bewitch the visionaries of the international community, cannot stop the sonorous pace of Hong Kong toward governance and prosperity, and will only make the world see more clearly the shamefulness and ridiculousness of ""American double standard.""The spokesperson reiterated that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The Chinese government is firmly determined to oppose external interference in Hong Kong affairs, firmly determined to safeguard China's sovereignty, security, development and interests, and is determined to fully and accurately implement the principle of ""One Country, Two Systems"" to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. China strongly urges the US to stop its wishful thinking of using Hong Kong to contain China as soon as possible and immediately stop the clumsy show of meddling in Hong Kong affairs. The Government of the HKSAR on Friday expressed strong disapproval of and firm opposition to the latest actions under the so-called memorandum by the US government in relation to the deferred enforced departure for Hong Kong residents in the US. An HKSAR government spokesman said, ""We firmly oppose the US government's baseless smearing in the so-called memorandum against the Hong Kong NSL. The US government stated its latest actions are in its 'foreign policy interest' without any attempt to disguise its motives, demonstrating sinister intentions and hegemonic bullying. National security is a matter within the purview of the central authorities. It is the responsibility and right of every country to safeguard its national security. The US has many laws on national security, but chooses to continue to wantonly smear the NSL and ignore the fact that the implementation of the NSL has enabled the livelihood and economic activities of the Hong Kong community at large to resume as normal, and the business environment to be restored. Clearly, this is hypocrisy out of political motivation with double standards, and a despicable maneuver with politics prevailing over the law. ""All law enforcement actions taken by Hong Kong law enforcement agencies are based on evidence, strictly according to the law and for the acts of the people, institutions or organizations concerned, and have nothing to do with their political stance, background or occupation. The US government's criticism of Hong Kong's law enforcement actions are a malicious fabrication. The HKSAR spokesman reiterated that ""The HKSAR government urges the US government to immediately stop any acts against the basic norms governing international relations, and immediately stop interfering in the affairs of the HKSAR.""Global Times                         "

Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said on Friday that US is working with allies and partners to ""preserve a peaceful, free and open Indo-Pacific."" Top US political leaders are aware that playing up such imprudent remarks will cause further damage to China-US relations, and even make China-US hostility become a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Xin said.The Pentagon official's attitude shows that they know the importance of maintaining the stability of China-US relations, he added. Experts said it cannot be ruled out that the US is trying to ""deter China"" by using the ""irritation-clarification and de-escalation"" approach, which occurred in Biden's several ""slips of tongue"" over the confirmation of US military interference in the Taiwan question. Given the provocation came before Blinken's possible China tour in February, some analysts believe that the US intends on using such military leverage for more gains in the bilateral discussions. Chinese military expert Song Zhongping believes that by hyping the ""threats"" posed by China's military, the US general is probably trying to get more military spending for his command.Although the Pentagon strives for balance in its budget allocation, commands will always ask for more military expenditure, including for training and equipment, to increase combat effectiveness, Song told the Global Times on Saturday. The AMC, according to US media, has nearly 50,000 service members and nearly 500 planes and is responsible for transport and refueling.Public information shows that before taking over at the AMC in 2021, Minihan served in a variety of Pacific-related roles since 2013, including as deputy commander of Indo-Pacific Command from September 2019 to August 2021.Analysts said that military personnel are generally cautious and avoid being imprudent when it comes to the risks of a real war because they are, after all, the ones who have to bleed on the frontline. But there are always some ""super-hawkish war maniacs"" in the military, especially at a time when many in the US are trying to win support by joining a race to show a tougher stance on China.

Chinese experts on Thursday hailed Ardern's efforts in the steady development of China-New Zealand relations under the COVID-19 pandemic and the US' confrontational meddling, as New Zealand's diplomacy has remained relatively independent during her tenure, in sharp contrast to some conservative forces among some US allies.In the post-Ardern era, whether Labour or the National Party is in power, experts expect the momentum in the relationship to continue, even though it may fluctuate under pressure from Washington.At a press conference Thursday, Ardern said her final day in office will be February 7, leaving some time for her successor to settle in as Labour party leader before the next general election to be held on October 14, according to New Zealand media One News.As for the reason for resigning, Ardern said, ""You cannot and should not do the job unless you have a full tank, plus a bit in reserve for those unplanned and unexpected challenges that inevitably come along.""Ardern added that she ""no longer has that bit extra in the tank to do the job justice."" She also stressed family factors, saying, ""I'm a politician who is first and foremost human.""Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Thursday that Ardern was a great friend and had ""demonstrated that empathy and insight are powerful leadership qualities.""Ben Thomas, a political commentator and former press secretary for the opposition National Party, said Ardern's resignation could spell disaster for Labour as ""she's Labour's number one political asset."" Ardern's resignation comes not long after a drop in popularity, with a November poll showing her approval rate dropping to 29 percent, the lowest since 2017, with 33 percent support for her Labour Party. Domestic issues such as housing problems, violent crimes, and inflation remain unsolved.  Some analysts also mentioned that US pressure could be a factor behind her decision. ""In contrast to Australia, perhaps New Zealand does not satisfy Americans under the Indo-Pacific strategy of containing China,"" said Yu Lei, chief research fellow at the research center for Pacific island countries of Liaocheng University.Compared with Labour, the center-right National Party has a closer relationship with US political and military circles, Yu said. Ardern, 42, who became New Zealand's prime minister in 2017 and won reelection in 2020, was once criticized by some media as ""speaking softly to China."" However, Chinese experts said she's ""a politician who truly understands international politics.""The active and steady diplomacy under Ardern's tenure was indispensable to the sound development of China-New Zealand relations during the COVID-19 pandemic and US containment of China, Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Thursday.As a member of the Five Eyes Alliance, New Zealand retained its independence and subjectivity, and did not blindly follow the US to press China like Australia's Morrison administration did, and withstood pressure from the US, Chen added. In a speech to the New Zealand-China Council in Auckland On December 9, Ardern said that New Zealand's trade and economic links with China had proven resilient. Ardern also expressed hopes of leading a trade mission to China as Beijing optimizes its COVID-19 response and border controls.Ardern is a politician who truly understands international politics and the trends of the world, Yu said. She knows that countries have different interests and divergences, but emphasizes mutual understanding, communication and cooperation, not just for China, but also for other countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, Yu said. Indicating that China would not comment directly on Ardern's resignation, which is an internal matter for New Zealand, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that China and New Zealand are important cooperative partners. Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 50 years ago, bilateral cooperation has brought benefits to the two peoples and contributed to regional peace, stability and prosperity. Chinese experts said that whether it is the Labour Party or the National Party that takes office, the general direction of China-New Zealand relations will not change, considering the two sides' deep economic and trade connections and the National Party's previous approaches to developing bilateral ties.China and New Zealand face some volatility if we take US interference into consideration, but it's unlikely to be too drastic, Yu said. China is New Zealand's largest trading partner, accounting for about 30 percent of its exports of goods and services, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. In 2021, China accounted for 42 percent of New Zealand's total exports of dairy products, 42 percent of meat and 65 percent of wood products.                         "

Israeli troops killed 10 Palestinians on Thursday, including an elderly woman, one of the deadliest days in the occupied West Bank since Israeli raids intensified at the start of last year, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday.On Friday, a Palestinian attacker shot dead seven people near a synagogue in occupied East Jerusalem before being fatally shot, media reported.According to a statement published by the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Sunday morning, China has been closely following the recent escalation of tensions between Palestine and Israel. We are deeply saddened by the civilian casualties caused by the Palestine-Israel conflicts. We condemn all terrorist attacks targeting civilians and oppose excessive use of force, the ministry said. The pressing priority is to do everything possible to deescalate the situation and call on all parties, Israel in particular, to show calm and restraint in order to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control, the foreign ministry stressed.The statement noted that the Palestine-Israel conflict has been recurring fundamentally because the two-state solution has not been delivered and the Palestinian people have long been denied their legitimate aspiration of establishing an independent state. The international community needs to act with a stronger sense of urgency and create conditions for the resumption of talks between Palestine and Israel. China will continue to work hard for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian question, said the Chinese Foreign Ministry.Since the escalation of the Palestine-Israel conflict recently, world leaders have called for calm amid rising violence in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu to discuss the horrific terror attack on Friday in Jerusalem, which claimed at least seven innocent Israeli lives, according to the White House on Friday.The State Department announced Thursday that the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to Egypt, Israel and the West Bank this weekend, as the US expressed alarm about escalating violence after Israel's single deadliest operation in the West Bank in two decades, AP reported.Shi Yinhong, director of the Center for American Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that over the years, the relationship between the US and Israel has been complicated. On the one hand, Israel is the most important strategic and military ally of the US in the Middle East, and the US is generally reluctant to seriously offend Israel on any issue.On the other hand, Israel's national interest agenda is not the same as that of the US. In particular, Israel is focused on the movement of its enemies or threats in the Middle East, especially Palestine, he noted.Blinken's visit to the region is superficially a ""fire-fighting mission,"" Shi pointed out. However, some Chinese observers questioned whether the US senior politician is heading to the region to ""put out the fire"" or ""stoke the fire.""They pointed out that Washington is no longer capable of leading the solution to the Palestine-Israel conflict, nor does it have a solid plan in place. Therefore, Blinken's visit to the region will have only limited effects.                         "

Their topics are ""not necessarily"" about the South China Sea but also ""overall global situation,"" according to the envoy. Besides, Austin may have a discussion with Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. on ""defense treaty concerns,"" CNN Philippines reported. Despite the possible discussions on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, North Korea and the South China Sea, the US' intention is always targeting China, said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University.""The US has gradually shifted its global strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region. In the future, it will further woo allies and strengthen strategic docking, intelligence and military deployment in the Western Pacific,"" Zhu told the Global Times. ""It cannot be ruled out that there will be more US-led actual combat training and deployments in the future.""Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday that the US tries to use its allies, such as Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, as pawns in its confrontation with China in the Asia-Pacific region. The US wants to achieve an effect where its allies serve as a vanguard against China first, and then the US engages afterward in a so-called strategic competition with China in a cost-effective way, Li said. The timing of Austin's visit parallels with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's visit to South Korea and Japan from January 29 to February 1. The US not only makes its Asian allies act according to its instructions on major issues, but also makes them actively strengthen contact with Washington's European allies to accelerate the pace of NATO's Asian-Pacific transformation, Li said. However, the US plan is not a plan for peace, but a plan that is likely to lead to conflict and war, which is extremely harmful to regional peace and stability, Li remarked. Austin's visit comes after the Philippines revealed that there has been discussion between Manila and Washington on conducting joint patrols in the South China Sea. Apart from the ""2+2"" top foreign and defense officials' meeting in Washington in April, Philippine media said that Marcos may meet with US President Joe Biden as well in April. Beforehand, Marcos is reported to be meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to discuss economic and regional security in mid-February. Since Marcos took office, the Philippines revived the dormant Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which allows the US to deploy conventional forces to five bases in the Philippines. Marcos, on the other hand, also expressed great hope, confidence and determination to further develop bilateral relations to a higher level in a friendly atmosphere during his state visit to China in January.""As a maritime neighbor of China and a member of ASEAN, it is indeed difficult for the Philippines to make decisions that satisfied all parties, especially against the backdrop of increased competition between China and the US… However, the future of the Philippines lies in the Asia-Pacific region, not as Washington's cannon fodder,"" Li said. Political elites in the Philippines should be able to clearly recognize the essence of the overall US strategy that uses allies as pawn, Li noted.  By the end of 2021, China had been the Philippines' largest trading partner for six consecutive years and became its second-largest export market, according to China's Ministry of Commerce. From January to November 2022, trade between China and the Philippines reached $80.41 billion, up 8.3 percent year-on-year.                         "

The experts predicted that Russia will launch a new round of offensive before NATO's assistance is transformed into Ukraine's combat capability on the battle fields.In an interview on Sunday with Portugal's RTP TV channel, Chair of the NATO Military Committee Rob Bauer said that the US-led bloc is ready for a direct confrontation with Russia Replying to a question on the matter, he asserted: ""We are ready."" But Bauer also stressed the precondition of such dangerous scenario, saying that ""NATO is going to respond only if Russia crosses the red line by invading one of NATO member states.""At the same time, Russia has recently declared more military progress on the battlefields. According to TASS, The Blagodatnoye settlement near Soledar of eastern Ukraine has come under control of Russia's forces, Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the Wagner private military company, said on Sunday.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times earlier this month that the performance of Russian forces in Ukraine has been improved since Moscow appoint Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov to serve as commander of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, and after a series of combat, Ukraine has suffered from great losses of troops and military vehicles and equipment. Bauer also admitted that the US-led military bloc should be better prepared because currently ""Russia has the military initiative."" This kind of concern among Ukraine and Western countries just made them agree to talk about more offensive military supplies after they reached agreement on the issue of supplying more advanced main battle tanks, said analysts. According to the AP, Ukraine and its Western allies are engaged in ""fast-track"" talks on the possibility of equipping Ukrain with long-range missiles and military aircraft, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Saturday.Podolyak said Ukraine's supporters in the West ""understand how the war is developing"" and the need to supply planes capable of providing cover for the armored fighting vehicles that the US and Germany pledged at the beginning of the month.However, in remarks to online video channel Freedom, Podolyak said that some of Ukraine's Western partners maintain a ""conservative"" attitude to arms deliveries, ""due to fear of changes in the international architecture.""Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""Kiev will always pay efforts to drag its NATO allies to directly fight with Russian troops in Ukraine, as this is probably the only way for Kiev to turn around the current situation. But Washington is not stupid, so it won't be used by Kiev, but will keep using Kiev to undermine Moscow.""Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Sunday that ""if Ukraine eventually receives weapons like F-16 fighter jets, armed by NATO members, and long-range missiles, as well as main battle tanks, then Kiev will be able to launch counterattacks in some regions that are currently controlled by Russian troops."" This could happen before the end of this winter or a period of time after the winter, Wei said.Song said that ""Russia won't wait and see Ukraine troops to get fully armed by those NATO weapons,"" so Russian troops will likely launch a new round of major offensive to maximize their advantage and victory before the situation gets more difficult in the future.Chair of the NATO Military Committee Bauer's statement that ""NATO is ready for direct confrontation with Russia"" is actually a clear message from the West that NATO won't get involved directly as long as Russia keeps its ""military operation"" within Ukraine, experts said. But now some NATO members like Poland are actually taking their own action to reinforce Ukraine, and this will create more uncertainty if Russia's potential major military offensive also cause huge casualties to the NATO members' military personnel in Ukraine, analysts said.Another problem is that if Russia cannot achieve major military victory before NATO military assistance to fully armed Ukrainian forces, Ukraine could bring great losses to the Russian side in Crimea and other regions within Russian territory, and then Moscow will have to retaliate heavily, and this would cause escalation for sure, Song noted. ""As long as NATO gets involved more directly, the situation would immediately turn into a confrontation between NATO and Russia, and the outbreak of World War III in Europe would become an event with high possibility,"" Song said.Since Bauer has said that NATO is ready for direct confrontation with Russia, it's clear that NATO is preparing for the worst scenario, and so is Russia, experts noted.  Zhang Jun, China's permanent representative to the UN, on January 13 called on the international community to create conditions for dialogue and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, and to redouble efforts to open up new prospects for peace in 2023.The current situation in Ukraine is a result of the deep-seated security imbalance in Europe, Zhang told a UN Security Council briefing on Ukraine, noting that only when parties concerned overcome differences and sit down at the negotiation table, a fundamental solution can be found to end the conflict and rebuild the European security architecture.

Following US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's meeting on January 18 with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, the US Treasury announced Yellen's plans to travel to China and welcomed her counterparts to the US in February. McCaul's follow-up hype on the ""China-US fight"" shows that some House Republicans are attempting to thwart the possibility of any positive outcome from the officials' meetings, if such meetings are still to take place, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday.Furthermore, when the economy and financial teams from Beijing and Washington enter substantive negotiations, there could be a window for improvement in bilateral ties, Lü said.

He also noted that the GOP cannot guarantee they have a long period as House majority, so they will make the most of the next two years to stir things up, the expert said. Compared to Congress' impact on the Biden administration's foreign policy, some analysts worry that when then control of the White House is relatively weak, adventurism from certain officials within their authority may lead to an unpredictable and irreversible situation.According to media reports, house speaker  and meets with the secessionists on the island.

But China should always be prepared for the unpredictable.""The key issue between China and the US is to avoid miscalculation, which means that starting regular dialogues are of vital importance to bilateral ties, Zhu said.                          "

The newly elected leader will replace outgoing president Miloš Zeman on March 8. Before his planned talk with Tsai, he spoke with Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday.As AFP reported: ""A phone call (with Tsai) is scheduled for Monday,"" Pavel's spokeswoman Marketa Rehakova announced.Observers said that the incoming president's China policy appears to have changed, and it may pose challenges and risks for him as the Taiwan question is an untouchable red line for China.The two sides may mainly talk about cultural and economic exchanges. But even that would be an affront to the one-China principle, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday. In a previous interview with Czech Radio, Pavel stated that he would support the relationship between the Czech Republic and the island of Taiwan.After being elected, Pavel was apparently eager to have a direct phone conversation with Tsai.

The development of China-Czech relations has been influenced by external factors in recent years, including moves by the US and the European Union. There was previously a balance in the Czech government's China policy.

Fortunately, most regional countries are fully aware of this danger, and are making efforts with China to withstand the potential threat by boosting regional integration, experts noted. Before Austin's arrival, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said to the Financial Times at the World Economic Forum in Davos earlier this month that he ruled out the reopening of the former US military bases of Subic Bay and Clark, saying it was against his country's constitution to allow foreign bases on its soil.Marcos visited China at the very beginning of this year, reaching agreements and achieving fruitful outcomes with China in fields including economy, trade, agriculture, and people-to-people exchanges, as well as infrastructure construction. The Philippines is a country that has learnt a bitter lesson of being used by the US to contain China, and its decision-making has reflected the vigilance shared by most regional countries on bloc-to-bloc confrontation, experts said. From the Korean Peninsula to Southeast Asia, many countries such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, all share bitter memories of US military presence and activities in their territories, and they know what will happen if the region falls into the Cold-War style bloc-to-bloc confrontation again, analysts said. Li said it's crucial that China and its regional partners work together to boost regional integration, because once a community with a shared future in the region has been built, there will be no room for external forces to make trouble, and it's also important for China to promote negotiations on a code of conduct related to maritime disputes in the region with other countries, so that they can effectively avoid conflict and miscalculation. Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday that ""NATO is a key tool that is used by the US to serve its hegemony, so it's important for China to make diplomatic efforts to let regional countries, especially its neighbors, understand that NATO is a military organization driven by a Cold War mentality, and it could bring tensions and problems.""Relevant countries in the region should not stand too close with the organization, nor should they become pawns used by the US to undermine regional peace and stability, and making sure a tragedy like the Russia-Ukraine crisis will not happen in Asia is a duty shared by all regional countries, Song noted.                           "

It also marked the first time that reporters were able to observe the real state of communication between the two sides.The atmosphere of the talks was also very harmonious, according to the CCTV reporter. The talks came a day after China announced to the world that its economy would return to normal growth in 2023.In response to the world's queries, China has responded confidently and frankly that it will not move toward a planned economy, but rather will remain open to the outside world, the report said.""Openness is exactly what China-US relations need,"" Yuyuan Tantian commented.Yellen did not attend the Davos Forum this time, meaning that the main purpose of her visit to Switzerland was to meet with the Chinese side, the report said.The theme of this year's forum was ""Cooperation in a Fragmented World."" Against this backdrop, it is of great significance that China and the US have agreed to strengthen cooperation during the meeting.The two sides agreed that the world's economic recovery is at a critical stage and it is in the interests of both countries as well as the whole world for China and the US to strengthen macro-policy communication and coordination and to jointly address challenges in the economic and financial fields, Xinhua reported.The two officials had professional, in-depth, candid and pragmatic exchanges on the global and bilateral macroeconomic and financial situation and on tackling common global challenges, Xinhua reported.But there was another detail. In the photo, Yellen held out one arm instead of two, which to some extent reflects the hesitant and conservative forces in the US and a lack of self-confidence, Yuyuan Tantian commented.China said it welcomes US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Yellen to visit China. Whether the door between China and the US can be opened will be a test of state of mind and the US should ask itself whether it is prepared, Yuyuan Tantian said.                         "

Another is to convince South Korea to stand closer with the US to contain China.""The US might also want to mediate the problem between South Korea and Japan, but this is not high on the agenda of Austin's delegation, Wang noted. In 2022, North Korea showed great progress in the development of missiles, and due to Washington's negative attitude toward negotiations with Pyongyang, the denuclearization process and negotiations on the security situation of the Korean Peninsula are still in deadlock. This makes the issue remain a good excuse for the US to increase its military presence in the region, Chinese analysts said.  According to the VOA on Monday, a senior US defense official said ""The security environment in the Indo-Pacific is growing more complex, which we see day to day,"" citing ever more ""aggressive behavior"" by both China and North Korea.A Beijing-based expert on international relations who asked for anonymity told the Global Times that ""it's clear that everything the US wants from its allies is basically about China. It's always about how to persuade or force its allies to cooperate with the US to contain China, and how to make the US' allies to pay the price for the US in a potential conflict with China."" Therefore, it is impossible to expect the US presence in the region to contribute to peace and stability, because peace would not provide an excuse for the US to maintain its military presence, the expert said. ""Washington wants to see tensions but doesn't want to see regional countries solve their own problems. This is why they leave negotiations with North Korea in deadlock but are keen to have more military drills with South Korea, and this is also why the US wants to reopen its military bases in the Philippines even though Manila is making efforts to develop friendly and stable ties with China,"" he noted.Economic recovery is the most urgent and important task for most countries in the Asia-Pacific region, so development, rather than security, should be the priority among shared concerns of the regional states, analysts said. The US can offer almost nothing for regional countries to recover the economy, but it is really good at spreading fear by using the excuse of security.

Under the impact of the US and the prolonged Russia-Ukraine conflict, both France and Australia are trying to maintain influence in regard to security in the region. According to the joint statement, the 2+2 consultations reflect the shared commitment to restoring a dynamic bilateral relationship founded on trust and shared interests. France and Australia expressed their shared commitment to Ukraine's security and their strong resolve to continue to support Ukraine, including joint supply of 155-millimeter ammunition.The two countries' priorities are to pay more attention to repairing bilateral relations that were severely damaged after the AUKUS issue and the current Ukraine crisis, Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday that France hopes to push forward its ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy and get deeper into the region through different partnership architectures, including the 2+2 mechanism with Australia. The new joint statement reads that ministers reiterated their ""strong opposition"" to any coercion or destabilizing actions in the South China Sea, which is different to the first of its kind released in July 2021 that voiced ""serious concerns"" about the situation in the South China Sea. On Taiwan, France and Australia ""reaffirmed their shared opposition to unilateral changes to the status quo"" and ""reiterated their will to continue deepening relations with Taiwan island in the economic, scientific, trade, technological and cultural fields."" That rhetoric was not in the 2021 statement. ""Australia is very eager to demonstrate its strength by engaging in hot button topics,"" Chen said. It is interesting that Australia, a country so far away from Eurasia, is a major supporter of Ukraine outside NATO.Though the new Australian government appears much less hostile to China, it cannot avoid the impact of the US when it wants to get more involved in international and regional affairs. Hence it still acts as a springboard, introducing US partners into the Asia-Pacific region in accordance with the US' strategic interests, Chen said.  Cui warned that France and Australia, in enhancing security partnership, should not cite ""tension across the Taiwan Straits"" as an excuse. Irresponsible remarks will not only affect their relations with China, but also further complicate regional situations, the expert said.Observers noted that the sensitivity of the Taiwan question as well as China's resolve to defend its core interests are clearer than ever. It would be very dangerous to cross the line.France wants to be a stabilizing force in Asia against the backdrop of China-US confrontation, French President Emmanuel Macron said in November 2022 during the APEC meeting of leading economies, three months after severe tension across the Taiwan Straits that was caused by then US house speaker Nancy Pelosi's provocative visit to the island.                          "

But what is ironic, according to observers, is that after years of ""whack-a-mole"" restrictions on a raft of Chinese tech firms, the Biden administration had to abruptly jump back to the original target.The playbook not only lays bare that the US' export controls were futile in undercutting Chinese tech capabilities, but also mirrors Washington's desperation to ""up the ante"" ahead of the so-called second Summit for Democracy in March, during which it aims to rope in more allies to push for industrial decoupling with China. The ban, when coming into effect, is estimated to have certain impacts on Huawei's smartphone and laptop businesses, though the Chinese company could substitute American suppliers with other companies such as MediaTek. The controls will strike at US companies more, which are already grappling with sliding revenues and huge layoff pressures, analysts warned. They also voiced confidence over China's ability to withstand the impact of the potential ban, as the country's preparation and countermeasures to the US offensive have grown increasingly mature over the years. From the industrial perspective, key tech breakthroughs have been achieved, and from the country level, government gestures have switched from defending to proactively counter-attacking, industry insiders said.The Biden administration has stopped approving licenses for US companies to export most items to Huawei, Reuters reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter.The Chinese company was restricted several years ago from importing 5G and other technologies from the US, but the US Department of Commerce then approved licenses for some American firms, including Qualcomm and Intel, to sell certain goods to Huawei, mostly technologies below 5G standards. Meanwhile, Washington is considering extending the ban to all US imports, though the ""discussions are at an early stage,"" a Bloomberg report said on Monday. This could include items below the 5G level, such as 4G items, WiFi 6 and 7, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing and cloud items, according to the Reuters report.In response, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a routine press briefing on Tuesday that the cutoff is pure ""technological hegemony,"" and China strongly opposes the US' generalization of national security concepts and extending abuse of state power to suppress Chinese companies. The country will firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese firms, Mao said. Some industry insiders describe the complete ban as a ""paranoid, last-ditch"" move that shows that while the US has been marshaling all its tools to curb China, all seem to have failed to achieve the desired results. It is also increasingly running out of cards and having to dive into more medium and fundamental-level spheres. ""Washington's logic works like this: If the US was able to beat down Huawei, a symbol of China's tech prowess, it could cripple the upward momentum of the Chinese tech industry, and hammer entrepreneurs' thriving confidence. But the strategy conspicuously did not work,"" Ma Jihua, a veteran telecom analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday.  Since putting Huawei onto the entity list in May 2019, the US has launched a full-fledged tech war against China. A flurry of over 100 Chinese tech giants and start-ups have been targeted since then, including TikTok, ZTE, SMIC, Yangtze Memory and DJI, citing claimed national security threats. The blockade had neither stopped Chinese companies' development nor their tech self-sufficiency quests.Huawei's rotating chairman Eric Xu Zhijun said in December 2022 that Huawei's overall revenue is expected to achieve 636.9 billion yuan ($91.59) billion in 2022, marking a critical stage of the company that has ""successfully pulled ourselves out of crisis mode."" Xu noted that Huawei's ICT infrastructure business has maintained steady growth, and the decline in device business has abated despite US pressure.Discussions on the measures were also revealed at a time when the US is ramping up pressure on allies, including the Netherlands, to join its cliques that exclude China. It also comes ahead of ""the Summit for Democracy"" in March, an arena which the US deems very important to pool allies' strengths to further isolate China. ""Washington is taking advantage of the potential ban on a signature Chinese tech company, to showcase its allies that it occupies a dominant position in the chip and tech industry chain,"" Ma said. A decision on the complete ban could be announced in May, coinciding with the four-year anniversary of Huawei's addition to the entity list, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. But Chinese industry insiders doubt whether the US has the audacity to fully execute the measures, as such controls are a double-edged sword that could end up backfiring, and that US politicians are always ""all bluster, but little take action."" Xiang Ligang, a veteran telecom observer, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the ban would hurt the commercial interests of US suppliers that deeply cooperate with Huawei, especially those already facing meager profit results.By 2025, US companies could lose 18 percentage points of global share and 37 percent of their revenues if the US completely bans semiconductor companies from selling to Chinese customers, according to a report by Boston Consulting Group issued in March 2020. The previous restrictive measures have already sliced billions of dollars off American chipmakers. Intel's revenue declined 32 percent year-on-year in the quarter that ended December 31, the fourth consecutive quarter of falling sales as the market for personal computers retreats in the US. Intel declined to comment on the news in response to the Global Times' inquiry.Xiang said that at the same time, Huawei's consumer business would also be impacted, as companies like Qualcomm and Intel are important suppliers of Huawei's smartphone and laptop businesses. But observers also took note of the possibility of sourcing elsewhere, such as from MediaTek, as well as Huawei's stepped-up efforts to make breakthroughs in bottleneck technologies. In the broader picture, the situation in China is markedly different from four years ago, when many tech practitioners were not yet prepared for a US-led decoupling push. At the government level, China has proactively spurred homegrown innovation and organized counterattacks against US hegemonic practices. It has also strengthened communication and cooperation with US allies.In December, China filed a lawsuit with the WTO over the US' discriminatory measures on its chip industry, firing the first shot of a slew of counterattacks against US suppression. It is believed that US allies and US enterprises will tend to be pragmatic when handling the requirements from the US government and find a new balance that fits their commercial interests, Tian Yun, an independent economist, told the Global Times.For example, in the case of lithography machines, recent media reports claimed that the US has pressured the Netherlands to ban exports of ASML's chipmaking machinery to China. But in a phone call between Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang with Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra on Monday, Hoekstra said the Dutch side will continue to handle trade and economic issues with China ""in a responsible way,"" suggesting a certain level of resistance toward meekly following US orders.                          "

While some countries such as Japan and the US are planning to end or downgrade their emergency status or epidemic management in the coming months, experts warned that the conditions for dropping the guard against the disease are still immature. COVID-19 remains a public emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the highest level of alert that the UN health body can give. However, the COVID-19 is probably at a transition point, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday at the health body's annual executive board meeting. The WHO's International Health Regulations Emergency Committee held its 14th meeting regarding the , after which WHO Director-General Tedros determined that the event continues to constitute a PHEIC, according to its website.The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a PHEIC in January 2020, and was characterized as a pandemic in March 2020. Statistics from the WHO show that more than 6 million people lost their lives during the pandemic.The WHO's International Health Regulations Emergency Committee acknowledged that the COVID-19 pandemic may be approaching an inflexion point given that global population has been achieving higher levels of immunity, either through infection or vaccination, which may limit the impact of the coronavirus on morbidity and mortality. WHO's decision would be ""prudent"" from the public health point of view, as the level of the epidemic development is different between countries and regions with some risks still in existence, particularly the risks caused by the COVID-19 mutated strains, Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), told the Global Times on Tuesday.Despite that China has seen high vaccination rate and high natural immunity, the country still needs to be cautious as there are still more research and work to do, Zeng noted. More research could be carried out on the reason behind the fast spreading, epidemic features and whether the XBB.1.5, which has become an increasingly prevalent strain in the US, will be prevalent in China, Zeng said. While countries entering a new stage of dealing with the three-year-old epidemic, experts warned that it's not the right time to completely drop the guard as sustainable, systematic and long-term monitoring and surveillance, as well as control action plans are still needed to mitigate the impact of the disease, especially when some countries like the US are seeing increasing deaths caused by coronavirus. The National Health Commission (NHC) said on Monday that the COVID-19 epidemic in China has entered a period of low infection with new cases steadily declining, highlighting the effectiveness of prevention work after the country .As the national epidemic situation entered a low infection period, the prevention work in rural areas remains the top priority, said NHC spokesperson Mi Feng,  stressing more attention should be put on health monitoring of key groups.When asked about whether some prevalent mutated variants such as XBB and BQ.1 popular in other countries and regions would trigger another infection peaks in China in the coming months, Li Tongzeng, chief physician from the respiratory and infectious diseases department at Beijing You'an Hospital, was quoted as saying in recent media reports that the possibility is relatively low that those strains trigger resurgence of outbreaks in the first half of 2023. ""Now many people have been infected, and they have gained a lot of immunity,"" he said. ""At present, we should still insist on wearing masks, washing hands frequently, and opening windows for ventilation."" In face of possible new waves of infections in China, some public health experts also called for stepping up efforts in areas such as adequate preparation of medicines, enhancing grass-roots-level medical institutions, regular monitoring system to collect key data and fully understand the overall infection situation and advance sequential vaccination. Beijing will soon launch a population serum antibody survey to fully understand the city's infection situation, Wang Quanyi, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Center for Disease Control and Prevention, was quoted as saying in media reports on Tuesday. The study will provide a reference for optimizing resource allocation and COVID prevention and control in the future, the official said.Currently the COVID-19 data and related analysis released by China's health authorities are objective, Zeng noted."" Rather than simply talking about whether or not to announce the end of the COVID pandemic, the WHO should come up with more specific action plans in terms of how to deal with the infectious disease in the future, for example, the flu is an infectious disease that is globally monitored,"" Zeng said. ""Will the COVID become an infectious disease from global attention to global surveillance? I think the WHO has not considered this point yet."" Despite that the WHO urged countries and regions to remain vigilant and continue reporting surveillance and genomic sequencing data, and take appropriate and targeted health measures to minimize severe cases and related deaths, some countries such as the US and Japan have decided to downgrade their COVID management in the coming months. The Biden administration of the US on Monday said it will end COVID-19 emergency declarations on May 11, nearly three years after the country imposed sweeping pandemic measures to curb the spread of the illness, Reuters reported on Monday. ""COVID still tops the major causes of deaths in the US and we still lack of conditions for canceling the status of major public health emergency because of the low vaccination rate of the second booster shot and the daily death increase,"" Chen Xi, associate professor of health policy and economics at Yale University, told the Global Times on Tuesday. To end the emergency status will surely affect the overall investment on antiviral drugs and research and development of vaccines with declining public funding to cover spending on vaccines and drugs, Chen said.                          "

The two countries signed a free trade agreement (FTA) that entered into force on July 1, 2014, according to the Xinhua News Agency. In December 2022, China and Switzerland achieved mutual recognition of the equivalence of auditing standards and audit oversight systems, according to China's Ministry of Finance.For accounting firms that are registered in the Swiss Confederation and the People's Republic of China respectively and issue audit reports on financial statements of economic entities, the audit oversight systems of the two countries are equivalent, the statement from the Ministry of Finance said.Despite this close cooperation, now a new area can be explored - vocational and professional education and training (VPET).Switzerland is well-known for its VPET as reports showed that about 60 percent of young people in Switzerland will not go to university and will instead choose from more than 200 occupations to start an apprenticeship course.  The Swiss Embassy in China hosted a Swiss vocational education exhibition in Beijing last month, as part of activities at the 7th edition of the Sino-Swiss Economic Form (SSEF). The SSEF started in 2010, and takes place biennially in Beijing and is by far the largest economic summit between Switzerland and China. Executives from Swiss multinational giants including ABB, Novartis, Nestlé, Roche, Schindler, and Swiss Re also participated in the event.In a keynote speech at the SSEF, Ambassador of Switzerland to China Jürg Burri noted that VPET is a great way to bring young people directly into companies.According to him, there are Swiss companies offering the double track education model in China. ""We can be proud of our companies that are acting as pioneers and showcase the successful Swiss education system,"" he said. Fang Naichun, director general of China Vocational Education Association, pointed out that vocational education can be a driving force for companies' upgrading and economic development.Global Times                         "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-02/a8bed494-b5ad-4e55-a968-af81a40983ad.jpeg," Senior officials of the US and US-led military organization NATO are continuing to create hostile atmosphere against China among its allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific region, but at the same time, the US is seeking more engagement with China to better manage the so-called competition and the US even wishes to cooperate with China on some issues of great concern to the US, such as finance and the economy, climate change and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Chinese analysts said the insincerity of the US side is very obvious, so China will also be cautious when it deals with the US. If the US refuses to correct its mistakes to fix the bilateral ties that have been unilaterally damaged by the US side since 2018, but  instead, keeps urging and using its allies to contain China, then Washington should not expect China to be cooperative in those fields.  According to the Associated Press, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in the Philippines on Wednesday for talks about deploying US forces and weapons in more Philippine military camps to ramp up deterrence against China's actions around the island of Taiwan and the South China Sea. In an interview with the Financial Times earlier this month, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos ruled out the reopening of the former US military bases of Subic Bay and Clark, saying it was against his country's constitution to allow foreign bases on its soil.On Tuesday, visiting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Japanese Prime Minster Fumio Kishida pledged to strengthen their ties and discussed ""challenges,"" including ""China's coercive behavior"" in the region. Stoltenberg also implied to the media that an incident like the Russia-Ukraine crisis in Europe could also happen in Asia while labeling China as a ""threat"" to regional peace.Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, responding to a question related to the NATO chief's remarks raised at Wednesday's routine press conference, said that on hot spot issues like the Russia-Ukraine conflict, ""China has always played an active role in promoting peace and negotiation,"" and that NATO should carefully rethink what role it has played in the security of Europe.""What I want to stress is that the Asia-Pacific region is not a battlefield for geopolitical struggles, and we don't welcome a Cold War mentality or bloc confrontation,"" Mao said.   The VOA said in a report that US experts hold low expectations for US State Secretary Antony Blinken's potential trip to China as they believe it will not ""reset"" ties with China. So far, the Chinese side is yet to confirm Blinken's visit despite the spokesperson of China's Foreign Affairs Ministry previously expressing an attitude of welcome.Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the reason why the Chinese side has held such low expectations is that it knew the US will not change its hostile attitude toward China, and it knew Washington will not be sincere in fixing the bilateral relations. ""China will also hold a cautious attitude to deal with the US. We are open to any efforts for engagement, but we are also clear that the US will not give up its attempt to contain China's development, and China will never give up its legitimate and rightful development,"" Lü noted.When US leaders and officials talk about setting ""guardrails"" for the China-US tension, they are actually talking about setting unfair rules and standards issued by the US and they want China to follow those rules to eventually contain China's development, a Beijing-based analyst said. However, China hopes ""setting guardrails"" is about making sure Washington does not do anything to provoke the China's core interests like the Taiwan question, he  remarked. The US will not get what it wants from China if Washington shows no sincerity to correct the mistakes it has made since it launched a trade war with China in 2018, and the tough economic situation will make the US pay a higher price for its China policies, analysts noted.                          "
Diplomacy,By Li Xuanmin and Fan Anqi  |  2023/1/19 22:09:45,White paper showcases China's firm resolve in green devt in new era,"China on Thursday released a white paper on its green development in the new era, elaborating on how the country has stayed firmly committed to green development, proactively participated in global climate governance and spearheaded international cooperation.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-19/bbd77067-b25d-4fa2-a6d6-f5d501f75d3f.jpeg," China on Thursday released a white paper on its green development in the new era, elaborating on how the country has stayed firmly committed to green development, proactively participated in global climate governance and spearheaded international cooperation.The white paper is issued at a time when the global prospect for climate cooperation remains murky amid a lingering energy crisis, with developed countries including the US and major European nations - among the largest greenhouse gas emitters in history - either derailing or flip flopping on their carbon promises, and pressing global environmental agenda being increasingly hijacked by some Western hegemonic powers and turned into their politicized tools to target China's ascending global influence.Despite the downside, China is not only embarking on lockstep toward its two carbon targets respectively in 2030 and 2060, but also actively helping the developing countries tackle climate issues via South-South cooperation, the white paper showed. The slew of concrete moves is an embodiment of China's commitments to the world as a responsible major power. More importantly, it sends both a resounding and encouraging message to the world, in the midst of chaotic global schemes and widened divisions, which observers said is set to inject new impetus to the global climate fight. The white paper, titled ""China's Green Development in the New Era,"" contains seven chapters, including China's commitment to green development path, green territorial configuration, industrial structure's further optimization, mechanism for green development and international cooperation outreach. According to the white paper, China, as the world's largest developing nation, has made remarkable progress in green development and great contribution in the global arena.As of the end of 2021, nearly 10,000 protected areas of various types and levels had been established, covering more than 17 percent of China's land area, bringing under effective protection 90 percent of its natural terrestrial ecosystem types and 74 percent of key state-protected wildlife species, the white paper said. From 2012 to 2021, 64 million hectares of trees were planted. Since 2000, China has led the world in greening the planet, contributing around one fourth of the newly added green areas in the world, it said. China is also making the fastest progress in air quality improvement. The average PM2.5 density of China's cities at prefecture level and above dropped from 46 micrograms per cubic meter in 2015 to 30 micrograms per cubic meter in 2021. A total of 87.5 percent of the days in 2021 have been good air quality days, according to the document. The proportion of clean energy sources in China's total energy consumption increased from 14.5 percent in 2012 to 25.5 percent by the end of 2021, while the proportion of coal decreased from 68.5 percent to 56 percent over the same period, the document said. By the end of 2021, the installed capacity of renewable energy was more than 1 billion kilowatts, accounting for 44.8 percent of China's overall installed capacity. The installed capacity of hydropower, wind power, and photovoltaic power each exceeded 300 million kilowatts, the highest in the world. China ""fully demonstrates its strong sense of responsibility as a major power… and helps build a fair, rational and mutually beneficial global climate governance system,"" Zhao Chenxin, vice director of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planner, said at a press briefing on Thursday. China has made the solemn pledges to achieve carbon emissions peak by 2030, and carbon neutrality by 2060. That target, if achieved on schedule, will mark the world's steepest reduction in carbon emission intensity and the shortest time in achieving the goal of going from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in global history, according to Zhao.   ""The white paper underscores China's unswerving determination to honor its commitment. Given the three-fold global pressures of energy crunch, food crisis and economic meltdown, it is an affirmation that China will not retreat from its global responsibility in coping with climate challenges, instead it is ramping up the role,"" Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Thursday. It is also released at a time when China is gradually walking out of the clouds of epidemic, and needs a momentum to realize high-quality growth, and green development is one of the potential drivers, Pan Jiahua, director of the institute of eco-civilization studies of the Beijing University of Technology, told the Global Times on Thursday. Observers said the stepped-up inputs by China will play a global exemplary role for both developing and developed worlds. On the one hand, developing countries could avoid detours and have a readily available shortcut. On the other hand, it serves as a timely reminder to certain developed nations not to dial back from their pledges.""Developed countries with capitals, sources and  aspiration could be encouraged to return back to the right track of development,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Thursday.Unlike some Western countries' flip-flop energy approach, China has shown consistency in its policy as it pursues a green path of development, which is borne out in the white paper. And such growth priority is further established by the tone-setting 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China report in October, which expounded China's overarching goal of modernization and identified the Chinese way of modernization as a new path of ""harmonious co-existence between man and nature."" The white paper doesn't disclose the amount of carbon emission reduction last year. But analysts expected that the amount being cut in 2022 was in parallel with the specific goals set before for each energy-intensive industry, such as steel, nonferrous metals and cement. In breakdown, many of China's detailed environmental indexes also championed the world. China has also supported an annual economic growth averaged at 6.6 percent with an annual energy consumption at 3 percent, according to the white paper. Compared with 2012, China's energy consumption per unit of GDP had dropped by 26.4 percent in 2021, making it one of the fastest countries in cutting energy intensity, according to the white paper.   In global cooperation, China has also made historical contribution to the conclusion and implementation of the Paris agreement, actively participated in South-South cooperation on climate change, and advanced international cooperation on saving resources and protecting the eco-environment. And it is also working with other countries on promoting green development under the Belt and Road Initiative, Zhao said. Pan said China has played a very active role in promoting and leading the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. Whether at the UN climate talks or COP15 at which world leaders adopted the historic Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, China has made undeniable contributions. China's pragmatic contribution in containing global warming runs a stark contrast to some Western countries, which analysts said do not fully face up to their historical responsibility, and always ""trumpet aloud but lack of substantial steps.""Li said that it is particularly ironic that the US, a long-time dominator of global affairs, takes a back seat in climate governance. ""The US is the strongest power in the world whether in terms of economy or capital and technology, but it has always been a deserter in dealing with global climate change,"" he noted. To date, the developed countries' pledge of $100 billion per year to developing nations remains unfulfilled, and there is no clear funding arrangement for the ""loss and damage"" fund set up during the COP27 summit.  During the COP27 summit that concluded in November, it is reported that Western countries, the main contributors to historical global greenhouse gases, were using the global platform to pressure China and other emerging economies to pay for the damage fund.  ""The West has always played a double standard when it comes to addressing climate change and reducing emissions, being lenient with its own requirements but particularly strict with those of developing countries, especially China,"" Li said.This double standard has made the international community realize the hypocrisy and slackness of the West in developing green economy, but rather, trying hard to use emission targets as a political tool to blackmail or slow down the rapid development of China, Li noted, while urging the West to give up its prejudice toward China and facilitate pragmatic cooperation.                          "

In so doing, the country is envisioned to become a global forerunner in key technology fields, a pioneer in advanced interdisciplinary areas and a major hub for world science and innovation.Fresh calls from the top leadership for a heightened focus on indigenous innovation, notably in core areas, turned out to be instantly a shot in the arm of homegrown technological trendsetters.In a statement sent to the Global Times on Wednesday, Zhang Jin, president of Siasun Robot and Automation Co, said that the momentous remarks are fairly inspiring.""We will strengthen our confidence, continue to innovate, and make China's robotics industry stronger, bigger and better,"" Zhang said.The robotics major based in Northeast China's Liaoning Province has completed more than 800 national important scientific and technological research projects, he revealed, and the company holds more than 1,300 patents.The top meeting arguably shone a spotlight on China's push for greater indigenousness in the technological space as the US-led campaign to decouple its allies from China in technology terms is shown to be running wild. In a fresh sign of such unruliness, ""the Biden administration is considering cutting off Huawei Technologies Co. from all of its American suppliers, including Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc, as the US government intensifies a crackdown on the Chinese technology sector,"" Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.The latest threat came on the heels of a deal the US has reportedly reached with the Netherlands and Japan to ban exports of some advanced chipmaking machinery to China, including advanced lithography tools.Rampant US moves aimed at containing China's technological advances have stoked market speculation over more government support to rev up the country's homegrown indigenous industry.China is reportedly working on a more than one trillion yuan ($143 billion) support package for its semiconductor industry, Reuters reported previously, citing three sources. In the past two years, the country has emphasized self-control and self-reliance in technology to prevent being throttled by others. Certain areas that were previously dominated by the West as technology centers are now shifting to China and other regions, said Liu Dingding, a Beijing-based independent tech analyst.Breakthroughs are being made in many fields, including operating systems and medicine, Liu told the Global Times on Wednesday.In the future, support policies will continue to be introduced, he reckoned, noting ""the development of science and technology requires the participation of more entrepreneurial innovators.""Science and technology is the basis for the development of economic power, and only the development of science and technology can enhance competitiveness, Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times on Wednesday.""What we are currently facing are not only bottlenecks in certain fields, but whether we have the ability to make breakthroughs in the entire economic field,"" Xiang said.The country's chip self-sufficiency rate hit 5 percent in 2018 and rose to 10 percent in 2020 and was around 17 percent at the end of last year, he continued, estimating that the rate would climb to 25 percent this year amid a wide-ranging effort to be self-sufficient in core areas such as chipmaking where the West remains dominant. In a sign of market expectations for more headway in achieving breakthroughs in key areas, chip shares led Wednesday's A-share gains across the board.Chipset shares rose by more than 2 percent while the flagship Shanghai Composite Index closed up 0.9 percent on Wednesday.

It adopted Resolution 2672 on January 9, allowing the delivery of UN cross-border aid into Syria to continue for a further six months.Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, called on the international community to make greater efforts in the next six months to ensure that the resolution is fully and effectively implemented.The cross-border mechanism of humanitarian deliveries is a temporary arrangement under special circumstances and ultimately there should be a gradual and orderly transition to cross-line deliveries, Dai noted.China welcomes the UN's updated plan for cross-line operations in northwestern Syria, and looks forward to seeing a more significant increase in the frequency of aid operations as well as the size of convoys, Dai said.""Cross-line rescues for the Rukban refugee camp in southeastern Syria should be resumed as soon as possible,"" said Dai.Dai added that unilateral sanctions and the resulting over-compliance run counter to the efforts of the Security Council and the wider international community to improve humanitarian access and increase humanitarian resources in Syria.""China once again calls on relevant countries to immediately and fully lift unilateral sanctions against Syria,"" he said.Dai pointed out that the current counter-terrorism situation in Syria is still complicated. The international community should adopt unified standards in accordance with international law and UN Security Council resolutions, strike at all terrorist forces in Syria with a zero-tolerance attitude and stop conniving, shielding and politically utilizing terrorist forces.The sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria must be effectively respected. The illegal stationing and military operations of foreign troops in Syria must end, and the illegal plundering of natural resources in Syria by foreign troops must stop immediately, Dai noted.US military forces in Syria have been slammed for stealing oil shipments from the war-ravaged country. After entering Syria in 2014, the US forces, under the pretext of fighting terrorist groups, have established military bases in oil-rich areas in northeastern and eastern Syria and started the systematic theft of Syrian oil.In mid-January, Syrian media reported that a convoy of 53 tankers was deployed to smuggle crude oil from Syria's northeastern province of Hasakah to bases in neighboring Iraq.The Syrian Oil Ministry said in August 2022 that the US forces were stealing 80 percent of Syria's oil production, causing direct and indirect losses of about $107.1 billion to the country's oil and gas sectors.Global Times                         "

Experts warned of aggravating situations leading to counteroffensive actions by Russia around the timing as the US and some other Western countries have continued to increase military support to Ukraine, aiming to consume Russia. About one week after the coordinated US-German decision to send main battle tanks to the  frontlines, Reuters said the US is readying more than $2 billion worth of military aid for Ukraine that is expected to include longer-range rockets for the first time, as well as other munitions and weapons.Ukraine has also been pushing to receive F-16 fighter jets from the US or other countries. Although US President Joe Biden responded ""No"" when asked by a reporter outside the White House Monday if the US would transfer the warplane to Ukraine, it does not appear that Biden's pronouncement is the result of an internal policy review but instead is the current stance of the ultimate decision maker, Politico reported citing unnamed officials.If F-16 fighters are delivered to Ukraine, it is very likely the Russian-Ukraine conflict would escalate, even go out of control, which the US is not ready to see at the current stage, analysts said.Fighter jets have stronger long-range strike capabilities. If the Ukrainian army is equipped with such weapons, it will definitely bring greater trouble to Russia and at the same time escalate the conflict. This is also a major reason why the US and other Western countries are hesitant to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighters, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Wednesday. It is highly likely that Ukraine could send F-16 fighters to attack Russia. This would constitute a serious provocation for Moscow and could result in severe destabilization which the US does not want to see, analysts said. They noted that the US is also worried about the consequences if an F-16 fighter jet is downed over Russian airspace. The US intends to use Ukraine to consume Russia, and finally reach the goal to permanently isolate Russia from Europe, experts reiterated, noting that although this goal is difficult to achieve, the US and its Western allies will sacrifice Ukraine, but never at the expense of their own interests.  The latest aid the US is readying is expected to be announced as soon as this week, Reuters reported Wednesday citing two US officials briefed on the matter.Western countries provide Ukraine with weapons nodes rather than weapon systems.

The enforcement falls under the UFLPA signed by US President Joe Biden in late 2021. Considering that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is reportedly planning a China visit in the near future, it is not surprising that the US has suddenly intensified its crackdown on Xinjiang products, Wang Jiang, an expert at the Institute of China's Borderland Studies at Zhejiang Normal University, told the Global Times. ""The US has once again pulled a card out of nowhere to pressure China, a routine tactic in US diplomacy.""However, since the US passed the UFLPA, it has never presented proof of even a single case involving ""forced labor"" in Xinjiang, but only ""a presumption of guilt,"" Wang noted.""Judging from the current market situation, I am confident that the domestic Chinese market is capable of absorbing most of the aluminum and aluminum products from Xinjiang… The local government is also expected to issue some policies to help the affected companies.""The US is trying to force China out of the global industrial chain, but not only is this difficult to do, its excessively high costs are also ultimately passed on to consumers, especially those in the US, observers noted.The expert noted that Xinjiang has recently organized a series of site visits by foreign dignitaries, especially officials from countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, giving many countries a glimpse of what is really going on in Xinjiang, even with the stigma imposed by the US. ""As the US tries to revamp its supply chain, China is adjusting its markets accordingly to ensure its quality products find a new outlet,"" Wang said.                          "

It is very obvious that the US is not sincere in helping these countries for development, but only care about ""great power competition"" with China, they noted. ""China has enough experience to withstand these impacts, and in the future, China will need to take US influence into consideration when planning more cooperation with the Solomon Islands and other regional partners, to make sure the cooperation won't be disrupted by the US,"" Li said.                          "

In recent years, the practice has kept expanding in scope, with US ""arms"" stretching longer and longer. Examining the cases of US abuse of long-arm jurisdiction, this report lays bare the severe harm it has done to the international political and economic order and the international rule of law.The US is the only sanctions superpower in the world, the report said. According to the Treasury 2021 Sanctions Review, by fiscal year 2021, the number of active US sanctions designations had increased to more than 9,400.The report also cited the examples on the US imposing unilateral sanctions on foreign countries such as Iran and Libya. Also, to maintain its economic and technological supremacy, the US abuses its public power to interfere with normal international commercial exchanges and competition. Under the pretext of safeguarding national security and fighting against human rights violations, it has adopted a package of measures including the Entity List and economic sanctions to restrict foreign enterprises from obtaining raw materials, items and technologies vital to their survival and development, according to the report. The timing of this report's release coincides with US threats to sanction more Chinese companies amid the Ukraine crisis, Huo Zhengxin, a law professor at the China University of Political Science and Law, told the Global Times on Friday. The US has been advancing a deal with the Netherlands and Japan to curb China's access to some advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment. The report was released at a time when the US has been expanding the scope of its long-arm jurisdiction to exert disproportionate and unwarranted influence over extraterritorial persons or entities, enforcing US domestic laws on extraterritorial non-US persons or entities, and wantonly penalizing or threatening foreign companies by exploiting their reliance on dollar-denominated businesses, the US market or US technologies, observers said.The report also mentioned the case of the imprisonment of a senior manager from the French company Alstom in 2013, which reminds the Chinese public of , a Huawei senior executive, who returned to China in 2021 after being illegally detained for nearly three years in Canada at the US' bidding. China's victory in the Meng incident could help slow the process by which the US uses its legal system to wage economic war against specific companies and inspire more countries to stand up against the long-arm jurisdiction of the US, former Alstom executive Frederic Pierucci, who was also a victim in the Alstom case, . The US holds a notorious record not only in its domestic governance but also in international politics, constantly exporting uncertainties to the world. ""Any responsible country should expose those US actions of blatantly interfering in other countries' internal affairs and disrupting global order,"" Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Friday. When the US, despite being so discredited, is reportedly planning to hold the second Summit for Democracy in March, this exposure will help the international community better understand its true face, Diao said.                          "

Gen. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters in a hastily arranged news conference where he addressed the ongoing situation, the Washington Post reported. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) continues to track the balloon's course, but officials would not specify its present whereabouts, the report said. US media also quoted anonymous Pentagon officials as saying that the balloon had traveled from China to the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, and through northwest Canada over the past few days before arriving somewhere over Montana, where it was hovering on Wednesday.In response to a question regarding the balloon, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday that China is looking into the report regarding the balloon. ""Before the facts are clear, any speculation and hype are not conducive to the settlement of the matter,"" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said.Song Zhongping, a military expert hit back at the US arbitrary accusation against China, saying that this is the latest example of the US hyping the China threat, introducing various topics to attempt to destabilize China.These kinds of stunts only serve to further strain bilateral relations and would also cast shadow on US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's reported visit to China, Song told the Global Times. The US said that Blinken will visit China between February 5 and 6. No information has been released from the Chinese side as of press time. In responding to the spy balloon accusations from the US, Liu Ming, an expert on spatial information and technology, told the Global Times on Friday that a sounding balloon usually flies in the stratosphere with the wind with its flying direction hard to steer. Liu said that there once were cases for excessive-pressure balloons to accomplish intercontinental flies but according to the pictures of the balloon released by the US, it is of zero-pressure type which cannot have long-distance voyage. Liu speculated that it is more possible that the balloon comes from a commercial boat sailing along the US west coast as they usually send such balloons to monitor the weather. The US military also sometimes fly sounding balloons during exercises to attain radar information and ensure security. For example, some civilian boats would fly such kind of balloons when the US Naval Air Station North Island conducts military drills to get radar information to avoid clashes with the navy, said Liu. Huang Zhicheng, an expert on aerodynamics, told the Global Times that according to the information released by the US, the balloon spotted in the US is of 40 cubic meters and can ""fly from China to the US,"" and only the US and China had the technical capacity to build this kind of balloon which can be directionally controlled, Huang said.""If the US has concrete evidence to prove this balloon belongs to China, it shows China has exceeded the US in technologies in the domain,"" said Huang, noting that the US is capable to use fighters and satellites to supervise the balloon, it should make public more direct proof instead of launching groundless spying accusations.Zhang Xuefeng, a Chinese military expert, said that it is utterly baseless for the US to say it is a spy balloon from China. China has satellite network and using this kind of balloon with such a terrible controllability and limited capability to carry 'spy missions' is meaningless, Zhang said.                          "

It is the first EU-Ukraine summit since the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and also the first since the European Council granted Ukraine the status of candidate country in June 2022. Speaking at the start of a two-day trip in Kiev, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the EU has pledged to double its military aid program for Ukraine by training an extra 15,000 soldiers, and that a 10th package of sanctions against Russia will be in place by February 24, a year after the conflict broke out, the Guardian reported on Thursday. While Europe is showing ""unswerving"" support for Ukraine in terms of military and financial aid, it is far from ready to admit the country into the EU at such a fast pace, as some member states have warned that it should be made clear that this will not be possible. France, Germany, Italy and the Benelux nations have also warned against striking an overly optimistic tone over the joint statement to be released after the summit, BBC reported, and last May, French President Emmanuel Macron warned it could take ""decades"" before Ukraine meets the criteria and achieves full membership.The last country to join the EU was Croatia in 2013, a decade after formally applying. For Ukraine's neighbor Poland, it took 20 years before it joined in 2004, according to media reports.The West is showing great divergences over opening a ""fast track"" for Ukraine's admission into the EU. ""Two voices are fighting within the system - one insisting that Ukraine follow the rules and join after meeting all the criteria, while the other says it should be handled as a special case, showing support for Ukraine by admitting it into the organization so as to further pull it in, which is also in line with the long-term interests of Europe,"" Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Friday. Ukraine did not stand a serious chance of becoming a candidate before the conflict broke out, analysts said, as it was far from being able to meet the membership standards given its less developed economy and outstanding corruption issues. A fresh wave of anti-corruption raids was carried out in Ukraine ahead of the summit in a bid to appease EU leaders. Among those targeted were residences linked to influential billionaire Igor Kolomoisky, one of the country's richest men, who has holdings in a slew of industries, including media, aviation and energy, France24 reported. The reason why Ukraine was able to become a candidate was out of political considerations, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday.""Saying yes to Ukraine has become a politically correct thing to do for Europe, but there are indeed difficulties involved in admitting Ukraine at this point, especially with a heavy fiscal burden under such high inflation,"" Cui Heng noted. ""They don't want their cake to be split even more, but they dare not say this when they feel themselves that they 'ought to do the right thing,'"" Cui added. The other reason the EU will not admit Ukraine at this point is that it doesn't want to anger Russia and stir up trouble that will invite conflict to its own doorstep, analysts noted.  Experts called on the EU to reflect on its stance toward the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and stop being further dragged down the vortex as it has been, which has brought about serious consequences including economic recession, an energy crisis, massive strikes and livelihood issues.Overall military support from the EU to Ukraine is estimated at being close to 12 billion euros ($13.1 billion). Overall assistance to Ukraine pledged at both EU and member state levels so far amounts to nearly 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion), according to data from the EU website.                         "

""But that would take a decade for eight to 10 submarines to be built and form a capable fleet."" Song pointed out that the US and the UK are more interested in, via the AUKUS, using Australia's military bases near its eastern coast. Through that, the US forces eye more flexibility beyond the Guam island in a war scenario.   According to media reports, Australia is also expected to host the US, Japanese and Indian leaders for the next Quad leaders meeting in Sydney in June.Though the Albanese administration has largely broken up with Morrison's hostility toward China, Canberra is still deeply involved in the US' China-targeted Indo-Pacific Strategy, observers said. Chen Hong, president of the Chinese Association of Australian Studies and director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Friday that Australia, if out of defense considerations, does not need nuclear submarines. Albanese administration's proceeding of the AUKUS suggested Australia will continue to dip its finger in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Straits, Chen said. Canberra hopes to maintain a delicate balance between trade and cultural connections with China while standing with the US in terms of security and geostrategy. Albanese has been playing well so far, but Chen warned such a balance would be increasingly difficult to maintain. AUKUS, from day one, is a small clique serving US strategic interests. When the US confrontation with China escalates, Washington will definitely keep up the pressure on its allies and partners, Chen said. Chinese Embassy to the UK also responded to the AUKUS progress on Friday, saying that the essence is to provoke military confrontation, which is pure Cold War mentality. It increased the risk of nuclear proliferation, aggravated arms race in the Asia-Pacific, and jeopardized regional peace and stability, which China is seriously concerned about and firmly opposes. The embassy spokesperson said that China urges the UK, Australia and the US to abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game, stop making small cliques, faithfully fulfill their international obligations, and do more things that are conducive to regional peace and stability.                          "

They exchanged views on China-Russia relations, bilateral or multiple coordination between the two countries and global and regional issues of common concern. The visit is believed to be one of regular meetings of diplomatic departments between the two countries. The interactions between China and Russia have frequently seen, from heads of state to diplomatic departments as the two sides strive to push forward bilateral relations, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Saturday. To mark the New Year, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, exchanged messages of New Year greetings on December 31.On December 30, Xi met with Putin via video link, during which Xi stressed that China and Russia should strengthen strategic coordination to bring more benefits to the two peoples and inject more stability into the world. In January, Lavrov congratulated Qin Gang on taking office as the Chinese foreign minister and expressed that he looked forward to building a good working relationship with Qin so as to lead the two countries' foreign ministries to continue their close cooperation.During Ma's visit, he emphasized that under the strategic guidance of the two countries' heads of state, the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era has maintained high-level development, with deepening political trust, steadily advancing cooperation in various fields and closer international coordination. China is willing to work with Russia to implement the consensus reached by the top leaders of the two countries and to make new progress in bilateral ties in the new year, Ma noted. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict was likely to be one of the topics to be addressed during the visit. The conflict has given rise to a number of challenges that require addressing, especially as the US continues to provoke tensions by offering Ukraine a stream of military assistance, Zhang noted. The US has agreed to send longer-ranger bombs to Ukraine when the country makes efforts to launch a spring offensive against Russia, according to an AP report. ""The fact that the US is constantly assisting Ukraine with gradually stronger weapons, rather than pushing for peace talks only exposed the US intention of taking the conflict as a method to contain and consume Russia. Continually pouring advanced weapons into the war may further complicate the conflict, resulting in escalation of the conflict and great risk of catastrophic spillover of the Russia-Ukraine crisis,"" Zhang noted. Qin earlier emphasized that China will continue to address the conflict based on fundamental guidance put forward by the country's leader which includes four points about what must be done and four things the international community must do together.

Experts said that US' reaction could escalate tensions between the two countries' militaries.,https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2020/2020-09-24/dc087b23-7c36-4369-8abe-91079143d6d6.jpeg," The Chinese Defense Ministry on Sunday protested against the US' move to shoot down a Chinese civilian unmanned airship which made an unintended entry into the US airspace due to force majeure. Experts said that US' reaction could escalate tensions between the two countries' militaries.The US' attack on Chinese civilian unmanned airship by force is an obvious overreaction, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement on Sunday.Tan's statement came after an F-22 fighter of the US Air Force fired an AIM-9X air-to-air missile and shot down the balloon, the Pentagon said on the day on its website, despite admitting that the balloon did not pose a military or physical threat.The balloon in question is a Chinese unmanned civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research purposes which made an unintended entry into the US airspace due to force majeure, namely the Westerlies and the airship's limited self-steering capability, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday.From a technical point of view, the US' move is like shooting a mosquito with a cannon, which is not only overreacting but also impractical, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.Compared with an unmanned, unpowered balloon that flies with the wind, the US interception method that featured an advanced stealth fighter jet and fired a missile is too costly. If more balloons, not necessarily from China, fly across the US, the US Air Force would be exhausted in intercepting them in this way, the expert said.It is more of a political show, as the balloon was only shot down after it already travelled across the US and was about to leave, observers said.China sternly protests against this move and reserves rights to take necessary measures in dealing with similar situations, Tan said.Tan's remark means that if a foreign airship accidentally enters the Chinese airspace, the Chinese forces could also shoot it down in a similar manner, and the US move will significantly impact the two countries' military-to-military relations, observers said.It is widely known that US aircraft, appearing in civilian or military purposes, operate around China much more frequent than Chinese aircraft do around the US, Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.If the US does not differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, then it has made a very bad precedent in treating the China-US relations, Lü said.The US frequently conducts close-in reconnaissance on China's doorsteps in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the East China Sea, sometimes in civilian disguises, according to think tanks and media reports.""If the US does not make the difference, should China make a difference? Should China also take reciprocal measures? The US must carefully consider the consequences"" Lü said.                         "

However, if some countries led by the US continue to break the bounds of ""assistance,"" the Russia-Ukraine conflict is sure to spin out of control.On Friday, the US Department of Defense announced a new security assistance package for Ukraine valued at up to $425 million, and another $1.75 billion in support for Ukraine under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative.In a statement issued that same day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken explained that this package includes critical air defense and counter-drone capabilities to help Ukraine, as well as armored infantry vehicles and more equipment that Ukraine has been making effective use of, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, artillery ammunition, and conventional and long-range rockets for US-provided HIMARS.The implication of these long-range arms is that Ukraine will have the ability to carry out attacks deeper into Russian territory. In response, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on Saturday that the supply of more advanced US weaponry to Ukraine will only trigger more retaliatory strikes from Russia, up to the extent allowed by Russia's nuclear doctrine, according to Reuters.The NATO bloc led by the US is using a salami-slicing tactic to send increased military aid to Ukraine. This could lead to another downward spiral for the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday.According to AFP, Zelensky has agreed that weapons supplied by the West will not be used to attack Russian territory. ""There is a consensus on this point,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview with the German weekly Bild am Sonntag on Sunday. He also said that such a consensus-based approach ""avoids escalation.""However, experts note that Scholz's remarks were more of an appeasement to Russia and an attempt to de-escalate tensions as it is unclear whether Ukraine will be able to keep its promise, experts warned.In an interview on Saturday, Fedir Venislavsky, Zelensky's representative in parliament, said that ""all military installations in Russia from which it is waging its war are legitimate military targets for Ukraine."" He also said that ""any command center in the Russian capital is a legitimate military target."" Venislavsky added that it is up to Ukraine's military leadership to decide whether to strike such targets.""Western support has been upgraded to include rockets with a range of more than 150 kilometers. Actually, this has surpassed the usual attempts and boundaries of aid,"" Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.The so-called consensus to not attack Russia is also a message from Zelensky to Europe, Zhang said, noting that this is a ""guarantee"" of security for Europe. However, now that the US has crossed a line by providing Ukraine with longer-range rockets, other countries may follow suit, which could cause a lot of troubles.Experts also warned that as the two sides have different definitions of ""territory,"" it can be predicted that escalation is inevitable and intensity in fighting will increase.Moreover, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine will not only escalate, but also threaten to spiral out of control. This is decided by Russia's basic policy on nuclear safety, Zhang warned. If Russia suffered a large-scale attack on its territory, it is possible that it will use a nuclear counterattack.The spread of ideological radicalization from the US leaves European countries with no choice, experts warned. But concerning the scale of aid, Ukraine is more likely to be defensive in the future and so-called long-range rocket attacks are just a means to exert psychological pressure on Russia rather than a de facto security threat, experts said.

The action was hailed by the US President Joe Biden as ""a success,"" according to US media reports. The ""balloon episode"" went viral on the US social media. A number of US hawks on China-related matters have been hyping the use of balloon for spying purpose and deliberately distorted it as ""a direct assault on the US national sovereignty."" ""The US attack on Chinese civilian unmanned airship by force is an obvious overreaction,"" Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, a spokesperson at China's Ministry of National Defense, said in a statement on Sunday. China will reserve the right to take necessary measures in dealing with similar situations, Tan said.Tan's remarks mean that if a foreign airship accidentally enters the Chinese airspace, the Chinese forces could also shoot it down in a similar manner, observers said.Biden was first briefed on the balloon Tuesday and has been receiving updates from his national security team, CNN said.

From the military perspective, the latest action of the US is like ""shooting a mosquito with cannon,"" experts said.  Although the US knows that this airship is harmless, it insisted on shooting it down to maintain its dominant position and it's also believed that the US is very interested in our related technology so that it needs to obtain it in such improper way, Lü Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday. ""In fact, such high-altitude balloon is equipped with cutting-edge technologies in terms of material, which the US side may have yet had. Shooting it down caused the loss for the Chinese side and the relevant technology research firm has the right to file claims against the US,"" Lü said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that the balloon is a civilian airship used for research, mainly meteorological, purposes. Affected by the Westerlies and with limited self-steering capability, the airship deviated far from its planned course. However, some US politicians and media have been hyping the so-called threat of this civilian airship, for example, Republican senator Tom Cotton and Texas governor Greg Abbott have been urging the Biden administration to bring it down, otherwise, it's dereliction of duty. ""From the US government to public opinion, the balloon incident has been exploited to instigate fermenting anti-China sentiment, which will only make the US' China policy more aggressive,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Sunday. The US ignoring the communication with the Chinese side further shows that the US lacks sincerity. Although it has been talking about setting the guardrails for the US-China relations, it has been blatantly sabotaging these guardrails, Li said.  The US shooting down the Chinese civilian balloon is also considered an overreaction from a technical point of view, said military aviation experts.Despite admitting that the balloon did not pose a military or physical threat, an F-22 fighter of the US Air Force fired an AIM-9X air-to-air missile and shot down the balloon,  supported by F-15 fighters, tankers and warships, the Pentagon said on the day on its website. The missile was fired from the F-22 from an altitude of 58,000 feet (17,678 meters) when the balloon was 60,000 and 65,000 feet, the Pentagon said. This is like shooting a mosquito with a cannon, which is not only overreacting but also impractical, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Sunday.Compared with an unmanned balloon that flies with the wind, the US interception method that featured an advanced stealth fighter jet and fired a missile is too costly. If more balloons, not necessarily from China, fly across the US, the US Air Force would be exhausted and may even be bankrupted in intercepting them in this way, the expert said.It is more of a political show, as the balloon was only shot down after it already travelled across the US and was about to leave, experts said.Some experts also believe that shooting down a harmless airship is like ""shooting down an unarmed civilian,"" creating a bad precedent for interaction between China and the US. It's widely known that US aircraft, appearing in civilian or military purposes, operate around China much more frequent than Chinese aircraft do around the US, Lü noted. ""If the US does not differentiate between civilian and military aircraft, then it has made a very bad precedent in treating the China-US relations,"" he said.The US frequently conducts close-in reconnaissance on China's doorsteps in the South China Sea, the Taiwan Straits and the East China Sea, sometimes in civilian disguises, according to a think tank and media reports.""If the US does not make the difference, should China make a difference?

In his speech, Korosi said that with climate change, floods, and droughts becoming more frequent around the world. It is estimated that in the next 20 years, about 400 million people around the world will be forced to leave their homes due to floods and droughts, which is unprecedented in human history.In response to the global water challenge, the United Nations will convene the UN 2023 Water Conference from March 22 to 24 to steer a shift in water decision-making and truly improve water security and stability. ""To meet such challenges, we must rely on scientific evidence,"" said Korosi.He thanked China for its contribution to the realization of the water goals set by the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, and affirmed that science-based solutions to the water crisis would also provide valuable experience for other fields to fully realize the Sustainable Development Goals.Water is the source of all living things and the cornerstone of all the Sustainable Development Goals. The world today faces a series of global challenges, such as climate change, and water is the key to meeting them. The world must use a united, sustainable, and scientific approach to solve the problem, said Kuang Shangfu, head of the IWHR.Chen Houqun, an academician at the Chinese Academy of Engineering and a senior engineer at the IWHR, elaborated on specific technical difficulties that China's large water conservancy projects such as the South-to-North Water Diversion Project and the Three Gorges Dam have overcome. He offered examples of cases to demonstrate the contributions made by these major projects and contributed to China's economic boom and social development, such as in low-carbon emission reduction.

A week earlier, the US and Germany said that they would provide Ukraine with offensive tanks. Dai pointed out that willful sanctions and artificial blocking of the flow of industrial and supply chains will only exacerbate the rippling effect of the Ukraine crisis, and inflict heavy cost on the whole world, especially on developing countries. ""All parties concerned should manage the spillover effect on global food, energy and financial security in a responsible manner,"" he said.The Chinese diplomat emphasized the safety and security of nuclear facilities in Ukraine, calling for an immediate stop of shelling the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and maximum efforts to stop the conflict from escalating to a nuclear crisis. ""We support International Atomic Energy Agency to remain engaged with Russia and Ukraine over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant issue to reach meaningful arrangements acceptable to both sides as soon as possible,"" said Dai?Dai stressed that China always stands on the side of peace, dialogue and humanity and ready to work with the international community to peacefully resolve the crisis.

It also proves that the Biden administration is incapable of setting so-called guardrails for bilateral ties under the complex situation within the US.China will keep calm and observe what the US does next, and whether Biden creates conditions for engagement or Washington allows bilateral ties to keep worsening, China is ready to handle any possible moves by the US, experts noted. Biden said on Monday that the US ""did the right thing"" when it shot down a ""suspected Chinese spy balloon"" on Saturday and maintained that he always wanted to bring it down ""as soon as it was appropriate,"" CNN reported. Speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House after returning from Camp David, Biden was asked if the incident changes the US-China relationship. He replied: ""No.""However, Chinese analysts consider that the recent incident and the hysterical overreaction of shooting down the airship are proof that the Biden administration is incapable of removing obstacles that were created by hawkish and conservative internal forces to realize effective engagement with China and to manage accidents with China via communication and coordination.In response to the claim by the US that they will not return the debris to China, Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a routine press conference on Tuesday that the Chinese government will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights. ""The airship belongs to China, not the US.""According to the VOA, the ""balloon incident"" will impact Biden's upcoming State of the Union address, as the president might focus more on how to deal with ""increasing pressures from China.""Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that ""as the leader of the ruling party who is actually governing the US, Biden should cool down the incident and manage the impact appropriately, rather than overreact and hype the tensions alongside the opposition Republicans.""But now the fact is that as the Republicans are trying to make the full use of the incident to accuse Biden of being weak when dealing with China, Biden is trying to use the incident to prove he dares to be tough against China ahead of the state of union, Lü said.China needs to be careful that the US might take further actions in retribution over the incident in the coming weeks after Washington feels it has been put in an embarrassing position. Shooting down the civilian unmanned airship with expensive missiles launched by an advanced F-22 fighter jet only serves to make the US look even more anxious and disgraceful, analysts warned. Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the incident reflects ""that whether we like it or not, the new Cold War launched by the US against China has already begun.""While the US is trying to engage with China, it has never stopped its sanctions and containment measures in the fields of science, technology, geopolitics and strategy, and the latest airship incident reveals that hostility against China within the US is ridiculously high, and is hard to control and manage. This is despite China's efforts to be fully sincere and transparent to minimize the negative impact caused by the incident, Jin said. The recovery of China-US ties and easing the tension cannot be achieved only by efforts from the Chinese side, which will be of no use alone if the US continues to be hostile, experts said. ""The partisan struggles within the US will keep bringing negative impacts for China-US ties. The Washington elites are getting overconfident as they believe they can emerge as the victor in the competition against China and Russia once and for all after the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Some even believe that China's GDP won't surpass the US', so all this make the decision-makers in the US become increasingly audacious when dealing with China,"" Jin said. ""More importantly, the US will keep being provocative on the Taiwan question. Not only does House Speaker Kevin McCarthy plan to make another provocative visit to the island, US politicians are also planning to invite Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the secessionist authorities on the island, to the US. In general, the prospects for China-US relations in 2023 are getting increasingly pessimistic and dangerous,"" Jin said.                          "

Turning an accident caused by force majeure into a political farce highlights the US' incompetence in dealing with crises, and the US' rude handling of the balloon incident is a serious provocation that risks derailing China-US ties and it will eventually pay the price for its recklessness.  On behalf of the Chinese government, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng was instructed to  on Sunday to the US Embassy in China over the US' attack on a Chinese civilian unmanned airship by force. Xie stressed the unintentional entry of the Chinese civilian airship into US airspace was an unexpected accident caused by force majeure, and that the ins and outs of what happened are crystal clear and clearly do not allow room for distortion or smearing. However, the US disregarded the facts, abused military force and shot down the civilian airship, which was about to exit US airspace, in what was an overreaction and a severe violation of the spirit of international law and practice.What the US did has impacted and endangered the efforts and progress for both sides to stabilize bilateral relations since the meeting between Chinese and US leaders in Bali. China is firmly opposed to and strongly protests the US' actions, and urges the US not to make further moves that violate China's interests, or to escalate the tensions, Xie said. ""The Chinese government is closely following the development of the situation, and will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese company concerned and safeguard China's interests and dignity, and reserves the right to further react in response to this matter, if necessary,"" Xie said.On Monday,  also said at the regular press conference that the unexpected case tested the US' sincerity in stabilizing and improving China-US relations and its manner of dealing with crises. China's latest opposition to the US' overreaction to the civilian airship came after the US military shot down the ""suspected Chinese spy balloon"" off the South Carolina coast on Saturday local time. However, the farce has continued in the US with GOP lawmakers calling US President Joe Biden's reaction ""a failure"" and asking why it did not happen sooner, while the Democrats hailed Biden's ""leadership."" Neither of the two parties seem to care about the aftermath of rudely shooting of a Chinese civilian airship, especially its impact on already strained bilateral relations, analysts said, noting that the Biden administration's failure in managing the anti-China sentiment fuelled by some hawks is erasing the room for China and the US to handle such incidents better, and may bring more turbulence to bilateral ties.   After bringing down the Chinese civilian airship, US Navy salvage vessels began collecting debris from the balloon in about 14 meters of water off the Carolina coast. Two US defense officials said they were working with the FBI and counterintelligence authorities to recover as much debris from the balloon as possible, including whatever equipment was on board and ""any material of intelligence value,"" US media reported.  Republicans have criticized the Biden administration for not shooting down the balloon earlier, before it was able to traverse several states and glide over sensitive military installations. But Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, praised the Biden administration's handling of the aerial incident.No matter how the Biden administration handles the issue, Democrats and Republicans will always find a way to attack each other, which is the norm in American politics, experts said, and with China as a target, the balloon incident has made inter-party fighting even fiercer. Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that it is extremely rude and unreasonable for the US to handle the matter in such a way, especially when it's clear that the balloon was only a harmless civilian airship and that the Chinese side has expressed plenty of goodwill and intention to communicate on the matter.The Biden administration cannot make a correct decision and properly handle the matter due to fear of being criticized by Republicans for acting ""weak,"" Lü told the Global Times. The US has failed in its ""emotion management,"" turning an accident into an incident, and with the shooting down of the airship, into a major incident in bilateral ties, the expert said. The US Senate is expected to receive a full briefing on the balloon on February 15, but the White House is pushing back and defending its actions.Both the Republicans and Democrats are hyping the balloon incident for their own political ends without considering the importance of stabilizing bilateral relations with China, especially in such crucial circumstances, Sun Chenghao, a research fellow from the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University, told the Global Times on Monday. Citing the incident, the US announced it was postponing Secretary of State Antony Blinken's reportedly planned visit to China, which had not been confirmed by China. Analysts said that while politicians in Washington have been talking big about putting up ""guardrails"" for China-US relations, they are actually doing the opposite, as some of them are becoming increasingly unscrupulous in challenging China's bottom line and making waves across the Taiwan Straits. The way the US dealt with the balloon incident also added more uncertainties to the already turbulent China-US relationship amid narrowing channels of communication.It is rare to see that in the first two years of a US president's term, there have been no visits between the heads of state of the two largest economies in the world, and ministerial-level visits have also been few, Lü noted. Sun said the Biden administration's incompetence in withstanding the pressure from anti-China hawks will encourage them to make more reckless provocations against China and push irrational anti-China sentiments, set up more hurdles for exchanges between the two countries and eventually destroy bilateral relations. The balloon incident happened just as the 2024 election campaign cycle is about to begin and may shed light on how US domestic political struggles will bind themselves to China-related topics, analysts said. More issues related to China, from trade and economy to high-technology and the Taiwan question, will be brought to the stage of US domestic politics, said Sun.As the world faces a challenge to bring about common economic recovery in the post-pandemic era, China and the US could have taken the chance to sit down and talk about pragmatic cooperation in many fields and inject positive momentum into their own countries' and the world's development, said Lü. However, the US seems unwilling to take such a chance to fix ties and ease tensions, and bilateral ties and the world are likely to see more uncertainties in the future, the expert said.                          "

Aside from sending rescue personnel, future assistance efforts could focus on medical care for the injured, the restoration of infrastructure for basic needs of water, power and transportation, and building shelters for people who have lost their homes. The earthquakes happened in the East Anatolian Fault Zone at the intersection of the Anatolian Plate with the Arabian Plate and the African Plate, which means high possibility of aftershocks of high-magnitude, Wang Tun, head of the Institute of Care-life, a key earthquake early warning laboratory in Chengdu, Southwest China's Sichuan Province, told the Global Times. How to ensure the safety of rescue workers operating under the risk of strong aftershocks is a major concern, Wang said. The Global Times learned from some Turkish people living in different regions in the country that the epicenter is densely populated. Infrastructure, especially roads and airports, suffered huge damage, which adds to the difficulty of searching for survivors.  In northern Syria's Aleppo and Idlib, thousands of buildings, including two hospitals, collapsed due to the earthquake. Millions of Syrians have been displaced by the long-running war in northern Syria, which poses huge humanitarian needs, media reported. Chinese nationals in Turkey have volunteered to help with disaster relief, and the first shipment of relief materials including tents, sleeping bags and blankets are expected to be distributed on Tuesday.Zhang Junyue, a vice president of the general chamber of commerce of Chinese enterprises in Turkey, told the Global Times on Tuesday that enterprises and employees known to the organization have been evacuated from the epicenter. Due to the huge losses by the earthquake, ""the power and the water supply in the earthquake-hit regions have been cut off, and the network doesn't work well,"" Zhang said.

In order to play a role in the region, Australia needs to cooperate with China rather than engage in unnecessary confrontations, which is also beneficial to the development of the region,"" Chen noted.However, some experts warned that it is impossible for Australia to turn from an extreme negative stance to a positive one at a time when the US has been very strict in containing and suppressing China.Ning Tuanhui, an assistant research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times that the Albanese government may consider the domestic resistance from some politicians and opposition parties when adjusting its China policy.""But it can be predicted that the trade disputes between the two countries will gradually start to be eased and resolved through dialogue,"" Ning said.Different from Australia, New Zealand's foreign policy and China policy are characterized by independence and maturity and adhere to the principle of serving its own interests.Albanese also said during the meeting that further details about the AUKUS submarine deal between the US, Britain and Australia would be announced soon.On the one hand, Australia wants to strengthen contact and enhance economic cooperation with China, but on the other hand, it also wants to strengthen military cooperation with the US to maintain the balance, Ning said. Therefore, it is important for China to maintain an open and balanced attitude, experts said.

In order to express the sympathy and support of the Chinese government and people to the Syrian side, China has decided to provide 30 million yuan in emergency humanitarian aid to Syria including $2 million cash assistance and urgently needed relief materials. At the same time, China will speed up the implementation of the ongoing food aid projects. Chinese relevant departments will also cooperate with the Syria to ensure the early implementation of the above-mentioned aid and help in earthquake relief and rescue for victims, according to Mao. China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) said on Wednesday that the Chinese government immediately launched the emergency humanitarian assistance mechanism to provide emergency assistance to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake happened. At the request of the Turkish government, the Chinese government has sent a Chinese rescue team to Turkey for international rescue. The 82 members of the Chinese rescue team, carrying 21 tons of rescue equipment and supplies, departed from Beijing Capital International Airport on a chartered Air China flight to the disaster-hit area in Turkey, according to CIDCA.The 82 members of the rescue team will mainly search those trapped under the building ruins as well as provide some onsite medical assistance. At the same time, Chinese people from all walks of life have extended a helping hand to Turkey and Syria.  named Ramunion from Hangzhou, East China's Zhejiang Province, has dispatched an advance team to Turkey to carry out disaster relief in the worst-hit areas. China has announced to provide Turkey with 40 million yuan of emergency assistance at the first installment. The Chinese government will continue to provide assistance to Turkey and Syria within its capacity in light of the development of the disaster situation and actual needs, CIDCA said. Global Times                         "

When it comes to the question about whether there are still effective communication and crisis management channels between the two sides, it also depends on the US, not China, Chinese experts said.  Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the US Xu Xueyuan on Tuesday local time lodged, upon instruction,  with senior officials of the US Department of State and White House National Security Council on the US attack on a Chinese unmanned civilian airship by force. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng on Sunday lodged a solemn representation to the US Embassy in China over the US shooting down the airship on Saturday. US navy divers began pulling pieces of the airship from the depths of the ocean floor on Tuesday, the AP reported. US counterintelligence teams hope to learn more about the sensors and other equipment on the remnants of the airship, the media report said. Despite China has repeatedly shared information on the unintended entry of the unmanned Chinese civilian airship into US airspace, the US not only went ahead with the use of force to take down the airship but has also continued hyping the incident, creating more obstacles for bilateral relations that were already strained over numerous issues, including the US high-tech crackdown on China and the Taiwan question. The Pentagon claimed on Tuesday that ""China declined a US request for a secure call"" between Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and his Chinese counterpart after the airship was downed, US media reported. US intelligence also linked the civilian balloon to a surveillance program run by the Chinese People's Liberation Army, according to the Washington Post. US officials have also been briefing allies and partners over the incident, media reported.   Commenting on the reported briefings, Mao Ning, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said ""It's a matter for the US itself and I don't want to comment on that. But I hope the US will communicate with other countries based on facts.""The US' downing of the unmanned Chinese civilian airship by force is unacceptable and irresponsible. China has lodged a stern protest. Exaggerating or hyping up the ""China threat"" narrative is not conducive to building trust or improving ties between our two countries, nor can it make the US safer, Mao said. The accusations by the US that China has rejected communication are untrue, Chinese observers argued, as China repeatedly told the US that the entry of the airship into US airspace was unintended. Also, as the unmanned airship is found to be a civilian airship used for mainly meteorological research purposes, it would be meaningless for the Chinese military to communicate with the Pentagon as the matter does not involve US security or defense issues. Although China repeatedly informed the US about the situation, the US insisted on taking arbitrary, irrational and destructive actions, which are irresponsible, Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The US has a contradictory attitude on this issue. On the one hand, it admitted that the balloon poses no threat to the US, but on the other hand, it destroyed it by force, Lü said. ""Maybe the US wants to steal some Chinese technologies if they refuse to return the remnants,"" he said. Some Chinese analysts believe that such a high-altitude balloon is equipped with cutting-edge technologies in terms of material, which the US may not have mastered.Over the past few days, the world has been closely watching ""the balloon episode"" with growing concerns that it could further complicate US-China relations and cause lasting damage. During his State of the Union address on Tuesday, US President Joe Biden said he is ""committed to working with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world… if China threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did."" It is believed that such remarks were referred to the balloon incident. Whether there are effective communication and crisis management channels depends on the US, not China, Lü said. ""What the US should do is to return the remnants of the airship to China.""Diao Daming, an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the US' immediate aggressive attack on the airship was not in line with international practice, and if certain US politicians continue hyping the matter, it will only further expose their ill-intent to jeopardize bilateral relations. ""Obviously, the balloon episode won't end soon,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. The US is now collecting and interpreting information about the balloon. The story is not ended, and someone has even encouraged the US to put a balloon in China's airspace in retaliation, Li said. The expert warned that China-US relations will become more competitive and conflict-driven because of the US misconception and actions. Under the criticism and hype of the Republicans and some extremist voices, Biden would find it more difficult to amend the China-US relationship, Li said.                          "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-27/80e6dd35-288b-4da6-aa76-2b12ac9af097.jpeg," The US has been criticized for pushing for more military presence in Asia out of a zero-sum game mentality and jeopardizing regional stability, after the US has managed to expand access to four additional military bases in the Philippines to boost its military flexibility in possible war scenarios with China.Analysts said that regional countries have become vigilant about not becoming cannon fodder for Washington's belligerence. Despite protests scattered around cities in the Philippines, including Manila and Quezon City, against the deployment of US forces and weapons in the country, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin pressed on with advancing the expansion of a defense pact, which allows the US to position military equipment and rotate its troops to four more military bases in the Southeast Asian country. The deal under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was announced on Thursday. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who took office last year, also met with Austin on Thursday. The US and some Western media ran a series of reports on the deal before it was finalized and claimed that this US military expansion was aimed at China's ""increasing"" threats in the South China Sea and the Taiwan question. In response, Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told a routine press conference on Thursday that defense and security cooperation between countries needs to be conducive to regional peace and stability and not targeted at or harmful to the interests of any third party. The US, out of selfish interests, holds on to the zero-sum mentality and keeps strengthening military deployment in the Asia-Pacific. This would escalate tensions and endanger peace and stability in the region.Mao also reminded that regional countries need to remain vigilant and avoid being coerced or used by the US. The Chinese Embassy in the Philippines also responded on Thursday, saying that during his visit, Austin smeared China over the South China Sea and pushed the US' anti-China agenda, which goes against regional countries' common aspiration for peace, cooperation, and development. It also runs counter to Filipino people's common desire to accelerate economic recovery, improve people's livelihoods and develop cooperation with China.From a military tactical point of view, the US military's access to more bases in the Philippines will grant US forces more flexibility if a conflict breaks out between China and the US over the Taiwan question or in the South China Sea, but that will not change the Chinese military forces' superiority on its doorstep along the first island chain, military analysts said.From locations in the Philippines such as Luzon and Palawan islands, the US military could cover the Bashi Channel to the south of the island of Taiwan and the Nansha Islands in the South China Sea, so it is likely the US will deploy surveillance, reconnaissance and combat forces in the newly announced bases, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday.With the modernization and rapid development of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) over the past decade, the US has acknowledged that the Philippines, together with other locations along the first island chain, is no longer secure. This is why it has been pulling back some of its forces to the second island chain, while also scattering its forces to more locations, making it more difficult for the PLA to strike them, experts said.Under this concept, the US did not aim to increase the number of troops in the Philippines, but sought to have more bases at its disposal, said Chinese military expert Zhang Xuefeng.Zhang told the Global Times on Thursday that the US now wants to deploy small but mobile forces in the first island chain that are able to harass the PLA, making it more difficult for the PLA to break the chain.However, these US forces are actually putting themselves in a dangerous position, as PLA's tactical missiles and aviation forces can easily cover them with large numbers of munitions, Zhang said.To counter the latest US move, the PLA should act to prepare more cost-efficient precision munitions and their launch platforms, in addition to increasing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance assets that can track, monitor and lock onto US' flexible deployment in real time, observers said.Song said that if a conflict breaks out, all US bases involved in attacking China will be targeted by the PLA, and the countries that host those US bases will inevitably get hit.The Philippines should not get itself involved in the confrontation between China and the US, but instead focus on domestic economic development and make joint efforts to make the South China Sea a sea of peace and stability, Song said.Although the permission to use additional bases in the Philippines is more symbolic than practical, the US will trumpet it as a major achievement for pushing its Indo-Pacific Strategy, some analysts said. As predicted, a release from the US Defense Department hailed the ""full implementation"" of the EDCA and boasted it as being ""a key pillar of the US-Philippines alliance."" The government of the Philippines has acted with more prudence on the deal to avoid casting a shadow over China-Philippines or China-ASEAN relations, as both the Philippines and ASEAN members have managed to maintain a delicate balance between China and the US, Zhou Fangyin, a research fellow at the Guangdong Institute for International Strategies, told the Global Times. The Biden administration is keen to fix its relations with the Philippines, which became strained under ex-president Rodrigo Duterte. The US has intensified its efforts to woo the Marcos administration to join the small US clique by hyping topics on the South China Sea. However, analysts said that the Philippine president is endeavoring to balance security and military with economic development, and has shown a positive attitude in handling disputes with China on the South China Sea. As the US persists in fanning confrontations to contain China, regional countries are encouraged to increase their vigilance for any attempt to destroy the hard-won peace and stability in the region, said analysts.                          "

The increasing reference to China in the address may also hint bumpier bilateral relations ahead with polarized political atmosphere in Washington and fiercer political struggle as the election cycle nears, analysts said. Starting with congratulations to new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, Biden, in his more-than-70-minute address, talked about US job growth, his infrastructure program, the rise in domestic manufacturing, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, oil dependency and America's strategic competition with China, US media reported. The Tuesday address was different from the previous one with newly empowered GOP lawmakers in the chamber sometimes shouting criticism at him, media reported. The State of the Union speech, on the whole, is Biden's self-promotion. Covering medical care, education, employment, gun crimes and the economy, Biden wanted to tout his ""accomplishments"" that had never been made by his predecessors, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times. The message that Biden's team wanted to convey to voters is choosing Biden to secure a democratic and better-guaranteed future. Although Biden attempted to paint a rosy picture to Americans, many of his ambitious plans, such as bringing back manufacturing, are facing various difficulties, said Li. The optimism in his speech failed to reflect Americans' increasing worries. Biden trumpeted his handling of US economy with decades-low unemployment and slowing inflation rates but the full picture is far more complicated with a decades-high inflation, predictions of a recession and a looming battle over paying the debt, analysts said. A Washington Post-ABC News poll also suggested that contrary to Biden's self-assessment for his first two years - it found 62 percent of Americans think Biden has accomplished ""not very much"" or ""little or nothing"" during his presidency.Biden's public approval rating stands at 41 percent in a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll that closed on Sunday, which is close to the lowest level of his presidency. Some 65 percent of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, compared to 58 percent a year earlier.Biden's low approval rating was not fully attributed to Biden or his administration's unadvised policies as a Republican president may not perform better due to the polarization of the US politics. It shows Americans have yet to reach a consensus on turning right or left as the country is standing at a historical crossroads, Yang Xiyu, a senior research fellow at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times. Yang warned that Biden's emphasis on revitalization of US manufacturing, infrastructure and technologies is an updated version of former president Donald Trump's ""America first"" and isolationism, prioritizing the US domestic needs over interests of the international community. Such a new version of ""America first"" will severely impact the global industrial chains. Biden's plans noted in the address, whether they could become reality or not, raise the alarm that trade and investment liberalization enters into a phase of adjustment and uncertainty, said Yang.  Multiple rounds of heckling were heard in the House Chamber from some House Republicans during Biden's speech, especially when Biden challenged Republicans to lift the US debt ceiling and support tax policies. When Biden said ""some Republicans want Social Security and Medicare to sunset,"" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy shook his head as many Republicans yelled ""no."" Some even yelled ""liar,"" the Hill reported. Biden's calling for unity between the Republicans and Democrats remains superficial and is more like a performance as he criticized, sometimes with harsh words, Republicans' political views, which would further widen the political split, said Li. The division illustrated in the House Chamber on Tuesday may also hint a bumpier road for Biden to push bills including a massive infrastructure bill in the last two years in office as Republicans took control the House of Representatives, analysts said. Biden referred to China six times in the address, double from three times in 2022. Claiming the US intends to ""seek competition, not conflict"" with China, Biden also vowed to modernize the military to deter aggression and to protect US if China ""threatens"" its sovereignty - a reference to the latest stunt in the US concerning a Chinese civilian airship. Some politicians, especially Republicans have been assailing the Biden administration and pushing a hard line in dealing with Beijing by lifting up voices on the ""China threat"" rhetoric. Biden attempted to persuade the world that the US is still in a stronger position in competition with China, Li said. Biden's tone in the address was neither as harsh as some US media predicted earlier, nor mild - showing a limited rationality in a polarized political atmosphere in Washington. Claiming to seek competition not conflict with China, American political elites should realize that the US' decline is rooted in itself, not China. The US is plagued by problems at home and abroad, and China is not the No.1 challenge, Yang said. In response to Biden's remarks on China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a regular press conference on Wednesday that China has always believed that China-US relations should not be a zero-sum game where one side out-competes or thrives at the expense of the other. China does not shy away or flinch from competition. However, we are opposed to defining the entire China-US relations by competition. It is beneath a responsible country to use competition as a pretext to smear other countries and restrain their legitimate right to development, even at the expense of global industrial and supply chains, Mao said.Analysts said that with criticism from Republicans mounting, Biden may find it harder to fix China-US relations. China-US relations may face more pressure in different fields and fiercer competition between the two largest economies does not fit the expectation from the two peoples and the international community.                          "

Such a move will not only trigger a strong response from Russia, but will also drag more countries into the crisis and further escalate the situation, said experts.In only his second overseas trip since the Russia-Ukraine crisis started nearly a year ago, Zelensky made visits to the UK and France on Wednesday. The Ukrainian president gave a speech to the joint houses of the British parliament in which he made a direct plea for more heavy weaponry, including fighter jets. Zelensky thanked the British people for their support since ""Day One"" of the conflict, as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said fighter jets were ""part of the conversation"" about aid to Ukraine.Sunak's spokesman Max Blain said the government was exploring ""what jets we may be able to give"" over the coming years, but had not made a decision on whether to send its F-35 or Typhoons.The Russian Embassy in London strongly warned the UK against supplying the warplanes, saying Britain would bear responsibility ""for another twist of escalation and the ensuing military-political consequences for the European continent and the entire world.""The sending of fighter jets to Ukraine has long been debated among Western countries. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky, said that talks over fighter jets were taking place with allied nations, but some held a ""conservative attitude"" that he said was ""due to fear of changes in the international architecture,"" Time magazine reported in January. It is very likely that the UK will set a precedent of flying fighter jets to Ukraine, which will directly change the situation on the battlefield, as it takes time to train Ukrainian pilots how to fly NATO-standard fighter jets, Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times. This means it is likely that NATO soldiers will be flying the jets, becoming directly involved in the crisis, he added.Moreover, those fighter jets are unlikely to be deployed in Ukraine, but will instead be based in countries such as Poland, which means those countries will also be dragged into the conflict, said Song. When meeting with Zelensky, French president Emmanuel Macron said France hasn't ruled out sending fighter jets, but he set conditions, such as guaranteeing that it will not lead to an escalation of tensions, the aircraft will not be used ""to touch Russian soil,"" and it will not result in weakening ""the capacities of the French army.""Song believed that apart from concerns over stirring up the conflict, Western countries are also worried that providing Ukraine with fighter jets will weaken their own air forces. It is likely that those countries will only equip Ukraine with second-hand, outmoded jets such as the Dassault Mirage F1, but keeping F-35s to themselves, according to Song.At the same time, Russia is also accelerating the pace of developing new weapons. Russia's TASS reported in January that Russia would induct new submarines, warships, and weapons systems in 2023 to bolster its military firepower. Four underwater vehicles and 12 advanced surface ships will reportedly go into service with the Russian armed forces later this year.Military experts said that the Western squeeze may further pressure Russia to rapidly develop its weapons; moreover, Russian weapons have been tested through an abundance of real combat experience, which will also help them to develop. Experts also warned that Western countries are now being hijacked by the toxic trend of competing to offer Ukraine weapons and aid in order to vie for influence. ""This is especially obvious now in Europe, with countries competing to offer military equipment to Ukraine to demonstrate their diplomatic influence,"" Zhang Hong, associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times.Despite this urge to compete for influence, Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, said European countries' hands are tied in how they are able to maneuver over the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Europe has been hijacked morally by the US on this issue, and been pushed to the front line of confrontation with Russia, thus those countries will eventually bow to the US' will.With the ongoing Russia-Ukraine crisis expected to escalate in the near term, experts warned Europe to maintain its strategic independence and try to assuage tensions rather than add fuel to the fire, otherwise it will open the door of tragedy to the whole of Europe, said Song.

Cambodia is one of them, and it holds high expectations of further upgrading ties with China in 2023, experts said.  On Monday, Cambodia saw the arrival of the first group of tourists from China after a three-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Xinhua News Agency reported. A plane carrying a group of some 140 Chinese tourists landed at Phnom Penh International Airport on Monday afternoon from the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, and the tourists received a warm welcome from Cambodian tourism officials and tour operators, said Chhay Sivlin, president of the Cambodia Association of Travel Agents.""We're very happy to receive the first batch of Chinese tourists in a group tour today,"" she told Xinhua. ""Their return is crucial to helping boost the recovery of our tourism industry.""The Southeast Asian nation is projected to attract at least 1 million Chinese tourists in 2023, said Cambodian Tourism Minister Thong Khon, Xinhua reported. Xu said that in addition to tourism, China and Cambodia will jointly deliver more benefits by further implementing bilateral free trade agreements and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will further their cooperation in fields such as infrastructure construction and energy. ""By developing a successful bilateral relationship, China and Cambodia are telling the world that China and many countries in the region have a traditional friendship, share similar development ideas and have consensus on important international issues,"" Xu said. Some external forces have tried to coerce China's neighbors to ""decouple"" from China, but their attempts are doomed to fail. External disruptions cannot shake the momentum of regional integration, which brings win-win outcomes to all regional members, Xu noted. Some Western media outlets, and US media in particular, have spared no efforts in hyping the ""debt trap"" in order to smear China's cooperation with its neighbors and partners under the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, but those tricks and lies will eventually be exposed as meaningless in front of concrete projects, substantial development and prosperity, said experts.Hyping the clichéd ""debt trap"" claim only shows that Washington is getting increasingly anxious as it fails to stop regional countries building a global community with shared future and become more resilient to its trouble-making efforts, Xu noted.

Diplomacy,By By Chen Qingqing and Bai Yunyi   |  2023/2/9 18:15:27,Exclusive: Balloon incident could trigger wider conflict if not properly handled: Chinese diplomat,"The balloon incident, occurred against the backdrop of a lack of trust between the US and China, should have been handled within the communication framework between the two sides without being exaggerated, the Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye told the Global Times in an exclusive interview. If the incident is not properly managed, it could become a trigger of conflict, the Chinese envoy warned.

If the incident is not properly managed, it could become a trigger of conflict, the Chinese envoy warned. ""Such incident should have been managed through the communication between the two sides in a quiet way and without affecting the mutual trust, as simiar matters happened often in the past and there's no need to exaggerate it,"" Lu Shaye, the Chinese Ambassador to France, told the Global Times on Wednesday night. Over the past few days, the US officials and media have continued hyping the ""balloon incident,"" turning it into a ""balloon episode"" and using it to smear China. Despite China has repeatedly shared information on the unintended entry of an unmanned Chinese civilian airship into US airspace, the US not only went ahead to greenlight the use of force to take down the airship but has also continued hyping the incident, creating more obstacles for bilateral relations. The incident occurred against the backdrop that the two countries lacking mutual trust, Lu said. Recently, the US made a number of unfriendly moves toward China on military, high-tech control and especially on the Taiwan question, which damaged the atmosphere between the two countries. Also, the partisan conflict inside the US politics also limits the room for the Biden administration to handle the incident, the Chinese envoy said. The US has a contradictory attitude on this issue, and eventually ""messed things up,"" turning it into an incident that will not help improve the bilateral ties, Lu said.US State Department said recently that US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has postponed his visit to China due to the balloon incident. But previous news on Blinken's visit to China all came from US media. Neither side made any official announcement. ""It also shows that the bilateral relations between the two countries have been freezing. The US said there should be guardrails set on the relations but we hope that the US side not to clash in recklessly and break through those guardrails,"" Lu said. ""Under current circumstances, especially after the US took a series of anti-China moves, Blinken's potential visit won't have any effect.""The US side should cool down before holding further talks with China. Also, under such circumstances, I believe it's inevitable that there's has been no communication between the Chinese and US defense ministers, Lu said. Some Western media and observers believed that the balloon incident threatens to be a ""watershed moment"" in the world's new superpower rivalry. The Chinese envoy said if the incident is not properly managed, it could become a trigger point for a wider conflict. ""I believe that we are very rational and have the strategic composure and confidence to handle it well. But the US needs to overcome its partisan conflict and interference and consider the matter from a point of view of safeguarding the common interests of humanity and the world peace, not just from the view of protecting its priority and hegemony,"" Lu said.                          "
Diplomacy,By fmprc.gov.cn  |  2023/2/9 20:04:46,Drug Abuse in the United States,"The challenge arisen from the use of drugs is an international one; it is most acute in the United States. Twelve percent of global drug users come from the country, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world. Based on facts and statistics, this report examines the gravity, causes and economic and social costs of drug abuse in the United States.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/nopic.gif," February 2023IntroductionI. Drug Abuse: A Social Malaise in the United StatesII. Enormous Social Cost of Drug Abuse in the United StatesIII. Multiple Causes of Drug Abuse in the United StatesConclusionThe challenge arisen from the use of drugs is an international one; it is most acute in the United States. Twelve percent of global drug users come from the country, three times the proportion of the U.S. population to that of the world. Based on facts and statistics, this report examines the gravity, causes and economic and social costs of drug abuse in the United States.◆ The U.S. National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS) lists eight categories of drugs most commonly used in the country: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, fentanyl, opioids (mainly referring to psychotropic substances under control), prescription stimulants, methamphetamine and heroin. Forty-six percent of U.S. drug users report having experience using cannabis and prescription stimulants, 36 percent opioids and methamphetamine, 31 percent prescription stimulants, 15 percent heroin and 10 percent cocaine.◆ In 2021, findings by NCDAS show about 19.4 percent of Americans have used illegal substances at least once. Out of the 280 million aged 12 and older, 31.9 million are drug users, with 11.7 percent on illegal substances and 19.4 percent either having consumed illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in 2020. If alcohol and tobacco users are included, the number of people in the United States who are abusing substances totals 165 million.◆ During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed cannabis at least once. Between 2018 and 2019, use of the substance increased by 15.9 percent. Though outlawed by the federal authorities, cannabis is legal in 15 states for recreational use. The cannabis industry in the country surged despite the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. When many businesses closed in March 2020 amid the pandemic, cannabis pharmacies in the eight states that legalized the substance were able to maintain their ""essential businesses"" because sales were allowed to continue during the period of mass home quarantine. As a result, legal cannabis sales in the United States hit a record 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, a 46 percent jump from that of 2019, according to BDSA, a platform providing cannabis sales data.◆ During the past 12 months, 10.1 million Americans have consumed opium at least once. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid is the primary driver of the spike in drug-related deaths. Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse -- more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year.◆ Each year, 95,000 people in the United States die from alcohol abuse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol. According to the latest data, 25.8 percent of those aged 18 and older reported binge drinking in the past month, and on any given day 261 Americans would die from excessive drinking, 80 percent of whom are adults over the age of 35.◆ Adolescents experience the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths. In this group, the 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs. For the 26 to 29-year-olds, it is 34 percent. Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group is becoming younger. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January 2021 and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than doubling the number in 2019. In addition, 47 percent of adolescents start consuming illicit drugs upon graduation from high school.◆ Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the U.S. population, greatly eroding the base of labor force and weighing on life expectancy. According to a report on the American journal Science, American death toll of drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years -- up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years. A record high of 72,000 deaths was registered in 2017. The report also shows drug abuse plagues almost all states in the United States, with only a few exceptions, i.e. South Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa. In the past decade, drug abuse deaths in the country have risen significantly; the numbers more than tripled in Delaware and New Hampshire. According to the CDC, in the year following the outbreak of the pandemic (from April 2020 to April 2021), more than 100,000 people in the United States died from drug overdose, eight times that of shooting incidents, and nearly tripling the number of deaths in traffic accidents. Between 1999 and 2017, there were more than 700,000 cumulative deaths from drug overdose in the United States. Drug overdose in the country has claimed more lives than AIDS, traffic accidents and shootings, and 70 percent of the deaths are men between the age of 25 and 54.◆ Drug abuse engenders frequent social problems. The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children. In addition, people caught using illegal drugs may be punished by being separated from their family and deprived of job opportunities, welfare assistance, public housing and voting rights. As a result, discrimination against drug users continues, and stigmatization will further intensify inter-generational poverty and racial discrimination. This forms a vicious cycle, which is detrimental to American society and becomes an ""American disease"" that cannot be fixed easily. As the protracted COVID-19 pandemic and growing inflation and unemployment exacerbate anxiety and the sense of isolation among people in American society, drug abuse has become increasingly severe, and the number of people addicted to drugs has soared.◆ Drug control incurs tremendous social cost. Such cost is entailed in crime fighting, health care, productivity loss, drug education and the prevention and treatment of other social problems. Among them, fighting drug-related crimes and health care cost the most. Since 1971, the United States has spent one trillion U.S. dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017, the cost of drug control in the United States exceeded 270 billion U.S. dollars.For years, the U.S. federal and state governments have vowed to vigorously tackle the drug problem, but have in fact failed to take substantive measures due to lobbying by various interest groups. Drug abuse in the United States is a reflection of deep-rooted social problems, and the result of an interplay of economic interests, lobbying, and social and cultural factors.◆ As the U.S. economy expanded after World War II, the rapid growth in national wealth created an unprecedentedly prosperous consumer market, including an active drug trade. By the 1960s, the nationwide hippie movement and the hippie culture it generated were ubiquitous in the United States, a part of which was ""drug culture."" Under the influence of ""drug culture,"" drugs such as cannabis and heroin quickly became popular among young people. The hippie movement brought drugs to the public, and its promoters claimed that cannabis was harmless and not a narcotic drug. Apart from that, they pushed for the social acceptance of cannabis abuse on the grounds of human rights and liberty, and called for its legalization. After the late 1970s, as the public witnessed the tremendous harm that drug abuse caused to society, families and individuals, there was a convergence in American people's perception of drugs and drug control. By the mid-1980s, calls for drug legalization waned, but there was no substantive improvement in the drug problem in the United States. Since the 1990s, calls for drug legalization have risen again in the country.◆ The U.S. government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations. Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in return, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization. The U.S. government has justified drug legalization to cover the fact that it would do anything for economic gains.◆ In 2014, cannabis was legalized in Colorado. Since then, the cumulative sales of cannabis have exceeded one billion U.S. dollars. However, the number of deaths from various kinds of drug abuse in the state has reached record highs. According to The New York Times, American parents said it got much easier for teens to obtain cannabis after its legalization in Colorado, potentially seriously endangering their brain development. Some experts said in interviews that they had treated a number of patients with symptoms related to drug addiction including severe vomiting due to cannabis use, including children who intentionally or accidentally consumed cannabis. The legalization of cannabis has further boosted the black market, which in turn puts great pressure on the judicial system and threatens social security. A large number of criminal organizations grow cannabis in Colorado and then smuggle it into other states where it is illegal, making the cannabis trade more active and law enforcement more difficult.◆ Knowing the serious social problems brought by the legalization of cannabis, the U.S. government has not responded by strengthening cannabis control, but instead further promoted drug legalization. Between its people's lives and health and economic interests, the U.S. government has chosen the latter, which is an important factor in the sustained push for drug legalization in the country. According to the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, an American think tank, one could hardly see in the National Drug Control Strategy issued by the U.S. government the important roles the government is supposed to play in fighting one of the biggest public health challenges. Instead, it has sat idle as drug and substance abuse worsens.◆ Interest groups in America keep fanning the flame of the drug problem. In order to maintain their profits, large pharmaceutical enterprises in the United States throw a large amount of money into sponsoring experts and associations to peddle the narrative that ""opioids are harmless."" What they want is to push for drug legalization and prod pharmacies into promoting drug sales and doctors into indiscriminate prescription of drugs. As a result, some patients have unknowingly developed drug addiction that they could not get rid of. After analyzing disclosed data from the U.S. Senate, the OpenSecrets website found that the marijuana and cannabis industry, which involved more than 20 businesses, spent as much as 4.28 million U.S. dollars on lobbying in 2021 alone. In addition, Amazon paid 14.5 million U.S. dollars between April and December in 2021 for funding lobbying activities, including for the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (MORE Act) which supported the legalization of cannabis. For the same purpose, the American Civil Liberties Union spent 920,000 U.S. dollars on lobbying between July and December in 2021. British American Tobacco and the Altria Group spent nearly 2.1 million and 6.6 million U.S. dollars respectively in 2021 on lobbying for the MORE Act. The House of Representatives actively considered bills that promote the legalization of marijuana and cannabis. ""We don't need to convince people to believe in cannabis. We need to convince them to buy legally,"" said Cory Rothschild, vice president of a U.S. company in the cannabis industry.◆ The drug culture influences America's drug policies. The U.S. drug culture has been shaped by the country's development history and directly affected the adjustment and evolution of America's drug policies. Due to pressure from both work and life, many people in the United States choose to take drugs for relief or leisure. Against this backdrop, in order to prevent people from using medical treatment as a pretext for drug abuse, U.S. federal law stipulates that one must present prescription by a doctor when purchasing certain drugs. However, this policy has big loopholes in terms of supervision, and drug abuse is prevalent in the United States. Pharmacies could still sell psychotropic drugs at will. As hospital reimbursement is directly linked to patient satisfaction, many doctors are forced to prescribe psychotropic drugs.◆ The COVID-19 pandemic has made long-existing social problems even worse in the United States, and the pressure caused by such problems as gun violence, racism, social injustice and huge wealth gap is increasingly felt by young people. The various difficulties faced by young Americans are a reflection of America's persistent social illness. On the one hand, the widening gap between the rich and poor in the United States gives young Americans more doubts about the ""American Dream"" as they could hardly see room for upward mobility. On the other hand, young people no longer feel proud of America due to intensifying social inequality, racial conflicts and other problems. A Gallup poll showed that Americans' pride in the United States hit a record low in 2020. Only 36 percent of the respondents aged 18 to 24 said they were proud to be American, while 35 percent did not express pride in being American. In December 2021, the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University published the findings of its survey, which showed that 52 percent of the respondents believed American democracy was ""in trouble"" or ""failing""; only 7 percent of young Americans viewed the United States as a ""healthy democracy""; 51 percent of the young respondents had ""felt down, depressed and hopeless"" at least a few times in the past two weeks; 25 percent of the respondents had thoughts of self-harm; and 25 percent of them believed the cause of their mental health problems was economic concerns. As young people's confidence in the United States drops dramatically and the pressure they face keeps growing, more and more of them turn to drugs to relieve their stress.◆ The drug problem is a manifestation of America's failure in social governance. According to Howard Koh, former Assistant Secretary for Health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the United States is one of the most devastating public health disasters. Apart from causing heavy burdens on the public health system, it could make millions of people lose their homes or jobs, become truant or face family breakdown. The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but in the meantime also amplified it. The crisis showcases the U.S. government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make prompt, unified and comprehensive response.The drug problem of America is a long-standing and deep-rooted disease that is yet to be cured. The U.S. government has not done enough to raise public awareness of the harm of narcotic drugs; the measures it took to reduce drug demand are ineffective; and its drug control actions produce poor results. The United States should face its own problem squarely, take actions to deal with the domestic issue of prevalent drug abuse, and protect the American people's right to life and health, instead of shying away from the problem.The fight against drugs requires, first and foremost, one's own efforts. At the same time, it also needs cooperation among all countries. The United States should stop making unwarranted accusations against China and undermining China-U.S. counter-narcotics cooperation. Even less should it mislead the public and shift its responsibility for ineffective response to drug abuse at home onto others.                         "

China reserves the right to further respond to the accident, the spokesperson said. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that it is reasonable and just to reject the US suggestion, as the country is not sincere in hoping for ""communication"" but instead showing a disguised form of ""coercion.""  After the civilian unmanned airship was identified, the US disregarded China's repeated communications and reiteration of its benign nature, and sent an F-22 to shoot it down on Saturday as the airship was about to leave US airspace. While collecting the remnants of the airship, the US also held briefings with partners and allies to paint the balloon as evidence of a ""China threat."" The US has been a destroyer of China-US relations all along, trying to force China into talks by intentionally creating a crisis. Its approach to dealing with the balloon, which was a pure accident, demonstrated that Washington lacks diplomatic etiquette and a sense of respect and equality, Li said. The US first intentionally jeopardized bilateral dialogue opportunities and hypocritically raised proposals for talks. When China responded and reacted reasonably based on US words and deeds - rejecting US proposals - the US started to mislead the international community as if China was the one to be blamed for the bumps in bilateral relations, Li elaborated. ""We have seen through the US' tricks and will not waste time on such talks when people on the other side are not being sincere in solving the problem,"" the expert noted. While proposing talks between defense chiefs, the US on Wednesday claimed the balloon was part of a fleet that spanned five continents.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at Thursday's press briefing that she is not aware of any ""fleet of balloons"". That narrative is probably part of the information and public opinion warfare that the US has waged on China. As for who is the world's number one country in spying, eavesdropping and surveillance, that is plainly visible to the international community, Mao said.                          "

The immediate needs include food, shelter, non-food items and medicines.  After being racked by wars for more than 10 years with conflicts in some regions still ongoing, Syria is in desperate need of humanitarian assistance, and the bad weather has added to the urgency, Ding Long, a professor with the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Friday.Regions affected by the earthquakes are under the control of the Syrian government and various opposition forces, and sanctions from the West, and the US in particular, have greatly hindered the rescue process, Ding said. Before the earthquakes, 4.1 million people - mostly women and children - relied on humanitarian assistance to survive in the opposition-held area, according to media reports. Syria has been under US sanctions since 1979 and the situation has only become worse since then. The US sanctions passed in June 2020, known as the Caesar Act, target companies, institutions and individuals - both Syrian and foreign - that do business with the government of President Bashar al-Assad by authorizing bans and financial sanctions on current and potential Syrian partners. The European Union has also imposed similar sanctions on Syria. The sanctions from the US and the EU have long been criticized for hindering Syria's imports of medical equipment and spare parts for a large number of public and private hospitals, some of which could otherwise provide better healthcare to millions of Syrians, analysts said. As Syrians have been denied access to heavy machines and medical equipment, they have to dig through the ruins with bare hands or use the very simplest of tools, according to pictures and videos circulating online. on Thursday, Mohammed Hasanein Khaddam, Syrian Ambassador to China, said that Syrians' suffering has been exacerbated by the disaster, but its root cause is the US' long-arm jurisdiction.""Many people are still under the rubble,"" the ambassador said. Buildings and infrastructure have been hit hard. Tens of thousands became homeless because large numbers of buildings are dilapidated and uninhabitable due to the first quake and the aftershocks, so the number of deaths is in the thousands and on the rise, with hospitals and medical centers overstretched.Syrian Arab Red Crescent (SARC) President Khaled Hboubati on Tuesday called on the US and the West to lift sanctions on Syria to facilitate relief efforts, as the country is in dire need of rescue equipment.Many countries, including China, also urged the US and the EU to lift economic sanctions to speed up emergency response and rescue work. However, the parties that have imposed the sanctions appeared to be deaf to the calls, claiming that they do not target legitimate humanitarian assistance. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a release on Thursday that the US has provided assistance in close coordination with partner organizations in Syria. Given the severe situation in Syria, it will be hard for a few organizations or people to effectively organize rescue and assistance, let alone the limited sphere of activities of the ""organizations"" mentioned by the US. Large-scale rescue work cannot be carried out without the organization of the Syrian government, said Ding.""The US should lift the sanctions, as civilians are those who are suffering the most. It should show sympathy, even though it doesn't have much, to the Syrian civilians,"" said Ding.The UN Refugee Agency told the Global Times that they echo the sentiments expressed by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who said on Thursday, ""This is a moment in which everybody must make very clear that no sanctions of any kind should interfere with relief to the population of Syria in the present moment.""Mick Wallace, a member of the European Parliament, tweeted on Tuesday that if the EU really cares about these people, ""could they show it by ending their illegal sanctions on Syria which have killed so many innocent people?""Blinken, the US' top diplomat, boasted in a tweet that the US was the ""leading humanitarian donor"" and the aid will ""go to Syrian people, not the regime,"" to which Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying commented: ""Then why are they struggling? You've been bombing, sanctioning, and stealing from them, and now you praise yourself for your charity?"" The US' hypocrisy has been fully exposed in Syria. On the one hand, it imposes unilateral sanctions to isolate the country and strangle its development opportunities, leaving helpless Syrians digging their loved ones buried in rubble with their bare hands; and on the other, the US continues to exploit Syrian resources, especially its oil, by either directly stealing it through smuggling tankers or ""buying"" at unreasonably low prices, Ding said. The US' apathy toward the Syrian peoples' misery shows how hollow its touting of human rights or democracy is, said the expert.                           "

In recognition of their contributions to the development of the conference, CICA Secretary General Kairat Sarybay awarded anniversary medals to diplomats including those from China for their distinguished services and valuable contribution to the strengthening and development of the CICA process.""China has made great contributions to the formation and development of the CICA. China was one of the first countries to support the establishment of the CICA and has been actively participating in its activities over the past 30 years,"" said Sarybay at the awarding ceremony.China has effectively chaired the CICA from 2014 to 2018. The successful summit held in Shanghai was the largest of all previous events held within the framework of the CICA, the ambassador noted.The establishment of the CICA has facilitated a new mechanism to find mutually acceptable solutions to regional security issues. Its uniqueness lies in the common understanding of CICA member states that peace and stability in Asia can only be achieved through dialogue, cooperation and enhanced mutual trust, he said.To cope with a shift in the traditional architecture of international security, the CICA remains firmly committed to its primary objectives - to serve as a platform for political dialogue and collaboration and to strengthen trust. At the same time, current trends in global geopolitics and economics require a realignment of the content and form of cooperation within the CICA's framework, Sarybay suggested. The ambassador expressed appreciation for China's support for the CICA's transformation initiative.Special Representative of the Chinese Government on Eurasian Affairs Li Hui spoke highly of the CICA's activities in ensuring regional security, strengthening political dialogue and confidence-building measures at the award ceremony, saying that China is willing to support further activities of the CICA.Chinese representatives hailed the role of the CICA in consolidating cooperation among member states to serve peace, security and stability and to promote tolerance, human coexistence, dialogue and sustainable development in the Asian continent and the whole world.The CICA now has 28 member states, nine observer states, and five observer organizations. The Summit of the CICA was held in the Republic of Kazakhstan in October 2022.                         "

They are deaf to the truth that really matters, and what is loudly hyped by them is often not the truth, but a false narrative,"" Mao said. On Wednesday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova urged the US to give an explanation over its role in the 2022 explosion of the Nord Stream gas pipelines. ""The White House must now comment on all these facts,"" Zakharova said in a post on her Telegram page.In response, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said on Wednesday that the investigative article was ""utterly false and complete fiction,"" while the CIA and Pentagon also dismissed the allegation using similar rhetoric, according to media reports.Some US media outlets had pointed to Russia as the likely culprit soon after the Nord Stream explosions in September 2022, but Hersh wrote that political elites from his country had more incentive to destroy the pipeline, considering their words prior to the incident.Global Times                         "

China is strongly dissatisfied with this and firmly opposes it,"" Mao told a press conference on Friday.Biden administration officials disclosed new information on Thursday about the capabilities of the Chinese unmanned airship and what they are learning as the FBI begins analyzing the parts recovered after the balloon was shot down Saturday, CNN reported. US officials also detailed what they've discovered about ""the broader spying operation"" they say the Chinese government has undertaken using a fleet of high-altitude surveillance balloons across the globe, the US media report said. Meanwhile, the US House voted unanimously Thursday to ""condemn the Chinese government"" for so-called balloon surveillance program. The US government said it has been engaging with 40 nations about the nature of the incident. However, when asked about which are those countries and does it mean the US is conducting the same so-called surveillance over these countries, Ned Price, spokesperson of the US Department of State, did not come up with a clear response in his latest press briefing on Thursday. It shows the typical double standards of the US government in handling the airship incident, which means that the US can conduct surveillance over other countries but cannot tolerate a non-threatening Chinese airship that unintendedly entered US airspace, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Friday. ""Obviously, when it comes to any incident or topic concerning conflicts with China, the US won't let it go. The US uses it as an excuse of sanctioning Chinese institutions, entities and individuals, accelerating the decoupling with China,"" Li said. However, Chinese officials and experts have been calling on the US side to take a rational attitude and remain ""cool-headed."" Considering the huge common interests between the two sides, it's unnecessary for the US to consume much more diplomatic resources to turn this airship incident into a dominant factor in the overall China-US relations, especially when the hyping of the incident has put the bilateral economic and trade ties at the crossroads, experts said.Xu Xueyuan, charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the US, also called for not allowing the incident to offset the efforts made by the two sides in maintaining the stability of China-US ties in a latest public address. There have been mixed signals from Washington in recent days, ranging from stepped-up crackdown on China's rising high-tech industry, an alliance approach to push for a West decoupling with China, to US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's explicit hope to still visit China despite strained bilateral relations.Observers said that stable and sound China-US economic relations play a key role in preventing disputes between the two countries from further spiraling up, and the ball is in Washington's court to show pragmatism to remove obstacles and address China's key concerns. Gao Lingyun, an expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times that the main problem that Yellen wants to solve by visiting China is the debt issue, not economy and trade.""Some recent moves by China on US Treasury bonds based on market principles could have some impact on the US bond market, especially when the US has hit debt limit [last month],"" said Gao.Gao predicted that the US will continue to hype up the airship incident for some time. It's like the US picked up a gun to use it against China. It may also serve as a bargaining chip to ramp up pressure on China.                         "

So the key at the moment is not about whether talks could happen between Russia and Ukraine again, but whether Washington and Moscow can reach at least some tacit consensus to avoid an escalation.""Chinese analysts said that the US is not ready or willing for talks with Russia at this moment. Based on the latest arrangements and decisions made by the US, the Biden administration is going to keep the conflict from ending and will keep using it to undermine Russia and the EU, and Ukraine is the price that Washington is willing to pay which Moscow understands clearly.Song said if Russia's call for talks is ignored by the US, then Moscow will be more determined to seek a breakthrough via military measures. This is likely to happen in the coming weeks or even coming days, as Russian troops need to launch a new offensive before the West's new military assistance to Ukraine is fully delivered.If Russia realizes full control in the eastern region of Ukraine, Moscow would be able to declare a halt to ""special military operation,"" and then a new basis for talks would be created. Western countries will need to reconsider how to deal with the situation with a more pragmatic attitude, and the divergence between the pro-peace European countries and the pro-war US could emerge again, said analysts. But the problem is that before there is hope for more peace talks, military conflicts and casualties would be unavoidable, they said. ""Russia's call is more like a political expression to show that Moscow is open to negotiations rather than merely seeking a military solution, but this is not a realistic idea that would receive a positive response from the US at the moment,"" Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Sunday. According to CNN on Friday, Biden will visit Poland this month to mark the one-year anniversary of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, ""returning to the region as the war enters a volatile new phase without a clear path to peace.""""The main purpose of Biden's trip to Europe at this time is to build momentum for his election next year. In addition, he also wants to suppress the pragmatic voices of peace in Europe and further put pressure on European leaders to jointly target Russia with a firmer hawkish stance, making a de-escalation of the conflict far from imminent,"" Cui noted.

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-02-06/3ad928c2-ad15-4ccf-bbbf-c0d7d3807047.jpeg," The Biden administration has reportedly devised a new plan to crack down on Chinese high-tech companies by considering a ban on US investments in those companies, a move experts said again reflects Washington's anxiety over China's high-tech development after many previously launched policies have proved ineffective. But this capital ambush will be no more successful than their predecessors, not just because Chinese companies are not solely reliant upon US capital, but because it will infuriate US investors with their $40 billion locked in China's artificial intelligence companies and other hefty investments.  According to a Reuters report on Friday US time, the White House is expected to unveil in the coming months an executive order to ban investments in some Chinese tech companies, while increasing scrutiny of others. The ban is anticipated to apply to some investments related to chip manufacturing, the Reuters report said. The executive order, if implemented, would be another noticeable move taken by the Biden administration to cripple China's technology sector after it announced an array of exports restrictions to choke off China's access to advanced chips and semiconductor manufacturing equipment in October. According to experts, on the one hand, the Biden administration's plan to ban investments in Chinese tech companies is in line with the US' long-term strategy of seeing China as a competitor. On the other hand, it reflects the ineffectiveness of previous US crackdown measures against China's high-tech rise, as the Biden administration is constantly adjusting the direction of its crackdown on China's technology companies, from choking off production means, disrupting talent flows, to the current means of curbing capital investment.""The Biden administration continues to double down on its crackdown against China's chip industries like a gambler's choice, in order to save face on past failures involving anti-China policies,"" Chen Jia, an independent analyst on international strategy, told the Global Times on Sunday.One example of the Biden administration's ineffective anti-China policies is the US-proposed Chip 4 Alliance which tries to talk away China's chip partner countries, as multiple news outlets have pointed out that it did not worked out as the US had planned. Ma Jihua, founder of Beijing DARUI Management Consulting Co, told the Global Times on Sunday that the pattern of the US crackdown on Chinese companies is becoming increasingly non-selective, as they tend to use whatever measures are at hand to hurt Chinese technology firms, regardless of how they backfire on their own economy. ""Curbs on investment are sure to bring harm to US companies more seriously than previous policies, as there's huge amount of US investment in Chinese tech companies as a result of high returns. Choking investment in this sector is liking killing the goose that lays the golden eggs for US investors,"" Ma said.A recent report by a Georgetown University think tank showed that US investors accounted for nearly one-fifth of investments in Chinese AI companies from 2015 to 2021, with transactions valued at $40.2 billion in total. Qualcomm Ventures and Intel Capital were involved in 13 and 11 investments in Chinese AI companies respectively. According to Ma, the US' action of mulling such self-hurting sanction policies reflects that they are turning from business-oriented thinking to a so-called national security perspective, which, if continued, is sure to bring more economic chaos to the country. Although the US seems to be absorbed with promoting separation between Chinese and US high-tech industries to dismantle China's high-tech sector, it cannot succeed, all experts interviewed by the Global Times on Sunday stressed.""The effects of the so-called decoupling policy hyped up by some US politicians is based on the assumption that there is a huge gap in scientific and technological strength between China and the US. But this is not true,"" Xiang Ligang, director-general of the Beijing-based Information Consumption Alliance, told the Global Times.In terms of capital investment in particular, Chinese tech companies do not need US capital as urgently as they did 20 or 30 years ago, as foreign investment from other countries is pouring into China, and the venture capital market has matured in China.Chen stressed that the US' total investment in China's high-tech sector is dropping in recent years, although they speed up investment in certain areas like artificial intelligence and transportation.""Now, the bulk of high-tech investment capital absorbed by Chinese companies is from China,"" he noted.China's research and development spending rose from 1.03 trillion yuan in 2012 to 2.79 trillion yuan in 2022, ranking second in the world. The spending in basic science research shot up 3.4 times from 2012 to 2021, China Central Television reported. Besides, the US would also face mounting internal pressure if the government bans investment in Chinese tech companies, particularly when the US economy has not been freed from problems like inflation, experts said. This will make it hard for the Biden administration to implement the ""decoupling"" policies as they have designed, experts said. According to the Reuters report, the Biden administration had planned to launch the executive order during the fourth quarter of 2022, but delayed the move ahead of US top diplomat Antony Blinken's planned trip to China.""The investment ban's progress shows that there's a lot of uncertainty regarding the timing and scope of US sanctions against China's high-tech sector,"" Chen said.In Xiang Ligang's view, the investment ban is likely a gesture used by the Biden administration to show that they are not soft on China ahead of the US presidential elections in 2024.""The new sanction is more show than substance,"" he told the Global Times.

With its enhanced security ties with the US and Japan, the Philippines' ability to resist pressure could wane, as the US will surely force its allies in the region to join its hostile Indo-Pacific Strategy. Marcos said on Sunday he saw no reason why the Philippines should not have a VFA with Japan if it boosts maritime security and ensures greater protection for Filipino fishermen. But he would exercise it cautiously ""because we do not want to appear provocative,"" Reuters reported. During Marcos' visit, the two countries penned a deal that allows their armed forces to work together during disaster relief, an agreement seen as a step toward a broader pact that could allow the countries to deploy forces on each other's soil, according to Reuters. Ge Hongliang, director of the China-ASEAN Maritime Security Research Center at the Guangxi University for Nationalities, told the Global Times on Monday that Marcos has reiterated having a pragmatic and independent foreign policy, and enhancing security ties with the US and Japan is part of that approach. Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday that such a VFA, if realized, will become a threat to regional stability, considering the Marcos Jr expects to beef up the Philippines' defense, but it is important to understand China's stance and the high sensitivity of such enhanced security relations with Japan and the US, Song said.Song pointed out that another priority for the Philippines is to accelerate the negotiations over the code of conduct (COC) in the South China Sea to exclude non-regional countries from the region, transforming the South China Sea into a ""sea of peace, stability, friendship and cooperation."" Both Song and Ge believe the Philippines is betting on both sides amid the US-China rivalry, but what will benefit the Philippines and ASEAN the most is upholding ASEAN centrality and a policy balance.                          "

China firmly opposed the US use of force to attack China's civilian unmanned airship, which was indiscriminate use of force and overacted, said Wang.For a long time, the US has abused its technological advantages to carry out large-scale indiscriminate clandestine operations and stealing of secrets across the world, including its allies, violating the sovereignty and interests of other countries and regions, and violating the international law and basic norms of international relations, Wang said. The US is deservedly the world's largest repeat offender for spying and use of surveillance empire, Wang noted.The US has also frequently sent aircraft and warships to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, with 657 flights in 2022 and 64 flights in the South China Sea in January this year alone, which seriously jeopardizes China's national security and undermines regional peace and stability, Wang said. It is also common for US balloons to illegally enter other countries' airspace, Wang noted.China's handling of the matters is responsible and professional, Wang said, in response to the question over how China responded to US high-altitude balloons illegally flying over Chinese airspace on at least 10 occasions.                          "

They said that the conflict is in fact a hybrid war staged by the US aiming to ultimately weaken and dismember Russia, with Ukraine, the unfortunate proxy and the direct victim, hardly having any say about its own fate.Addressing the General Assembly in New York on Monday, United Nation (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres said that he fears the likelihood of further escalation in the Russia-Ukraine conflict means the world is heading toward a ""wider war."" ""The prospects for peace keep diminishing. The chances of further escalation and bloodshed keep growing,"" Guterres said.China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dai Bing  briefing on Monday that conflicts on the ground show no signs of easing up, the logic of military solution still prevails, and a large number of heavy weapons keep pouring into the battlefields. The international community deplores the humanitarian cost of the conflict. But the parties concerned lack the sincerity to promote peace talks and the determination to resolve the issue politically.Despite the international community crying for peace, the US has revealed plans to reinforce Ukraine's defense in the long-term perspective, media cited US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan on Monday. ""We are thinking not just about today's fight, but about the future capacity for Ukraine to defend itself and deter Russian aggression down the road,"" Sullivan said at a virtual conference on Monday. He effectively confirmed that the US is considering shipment of F-16 planes and other complex weapons to Kiev at some point.""It is not surprising the US is playing the long game and it will not call a truce until it achieves its goal of weakening and dismembering Russia. However, in the process, Ukraine will inevitably become the biggest victim, and Europe, abducted by the US strategy driven by Cold War mentality, is paying the second worst price,"" Song Zhongping, a military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that the US has benefited from the conflict - weakening Russia while strengthening its control over Europe - and also made quite awesome gains by selling energy, weapons and grains. No wonder the US wants the conflict to continue.As the conflict prolongs, European assets would be forced to flee to the US, helping the US to rein in inflation and secure the dollar hegemony; while in the political terms, the conflict has become US President Joe Biden's political assets and would be a useful part of his campaign for the 2024 elections, Cui said. The US, despite gaining short-term profits from energy and arms trade, will eventually lose, as the international community has increasingly noticed the untrustworthy nature of the US hegemony. De-dollarization and de-hegemony have become more and more a global consensus, Song said.  Biden, claiming to show support for Ukraine, is scheduled to visit Poland, which neighbors Ukraine, at the end of February to mark the anniversary of the conflict which broke out on February 24, 2022, NBC News reported on Tuesday. The first anniversary will be a perfect timing for shrewd politicians like Biden to put on a political show, Chinese analysts said. But taking sides between Ukraine and Russia won't help solve the problem, as the nature of the conflict is a US-staged hybrid war targeting Russia with Ukraine as the proxy. The European Council has also invited Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to attend an EU summit in Brussels on February 9-10.Inviting Zelensky to the summit is clearly to further appease Ukraine after  dashed Ukraine's hope for a quick EU membership, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Zelensky will no doubt take the February summit as a stage for his political show and reiterate his sincerity of joining the EU. However, the old Europe such as France and Germany would unlikely play along, for fear of irritating Russia and losing a wiggle room, Cui Heng said. Turkey, which has been making efforts to join the EU since 1987, would also be upset if Ukraine, a country far from meeting the Copenhagen criteria for membership, could join the EU so soon, Cui Heng explained. Cui Hongjian warned that if the US-led West keeps providing military aid to Ukraine, there would be no foundation for diplomatic negotiations. Overall military support from the EU to Ukraine is estimated at around 12 billion euros ($13.1 billion). Overall assistance to Ukraine pledged by the EU and individual member state amounts to nearly 50 billion euros ($54.5 billion) so far, according to data from the EU website.What China can do is to push forward the direct dialogues between the US and Russia in a bilateral or multilateral framework, which could provide key ground for peace talks to resolve the conflict, Cui Hongjian said.

The operation marks the third day in a row that an unidentified object has been shot down over North American airspace after a Chinese civilian unmanned airship used mainly for meteorological research purposes was taken down on February 4. The US' frequent use of its armed forces to shoot down so-called unidentified objects only exposed its paranoia and hysteria, which also reflected its vulnerability, Chinese experts said.The Chinese civilian unmanned airship flying into US airspace is an accident caused by force majeure, but the US' frequent firing of advanced missiles to shoot down unidentified flying objects is an excessive use of force, Wang said.The practice was not only questioned by many people in the US but also wasted taxpayers' money without bringing actual benefits to its people, Wang said. In fact, the US is the world's largest surveillance and reconnaissance country, with the largest global spying network, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said. The US' National Security Agency (NSA) monitors the content of text messages and calls of political leaders in Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and other European countries. The US secretly installed monitoring equipment in nearly 100 of its embassies and consulates abroad to steal secrets from the host country, Wang said.According to a report by information security media agency ""Anzer"" in 2022, the NSA remotely stole 971 pieces of global Internet data and 1,241 phone records in 30 days, involving the personal privacy of a large number of citizens in various countries. Recently, an unmanned US boat used to gather data underwater was discovered in the waters of Namibia. Local media generally believe that this unmanned boat is actually a US spy ship. How many spy airship and balloons has the US launched around the world? The US knows very well. Who is the world's largest spy monitoring empire? The international community also sees this very clearly, Wang said. The US has also frequently sent aircraft and warships to conduct close-in reconnaissance on China, with 657 flights in 2022 and 64 flights in the South China Sea in January this year alone, which seriously jeopardized China's national security and undermined regional peace and stability, Wang said.  Despite White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Monday denied that the US has been flying balloons over China, Chinese experts said that the facts pointed out by China are setting things straight, and allow the global community to understand the truth and facts about the US-China conflict and help other countries see through the US-led slander and smear campaign against China, some experts said. The latest development also happened after an F-16 fighter shot down the airborne object flying at an altitude of about 6,000 meters over the state of Michigan on Sunday. On Saturday, a US F-22 warplane fired a missile that shot down an object flying at 12,000 meters over the Yukon in the far north of Canada on the joint orders of Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""It's unlikely that the most recent three unidentified objects belong to China, as they flew at much lower altitudes compared to the Chinese high-altitude balloon. Judging from the altitude, they are completely different types of object,"" Lü Xiang, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Monday. ""It's highly likely that the US, due to certain emotions, has to attach more importance to matters that they did not pay attention to before,"" Lü said. ""Using advanced missiles to shoot down those objects is like shooting a mosquito with cannon.""Some Chinese experts believe that the US is now in a paradoxical mindset. On the one hand, it has to increase so-called monitoring of its airspace following the Chinese balloon incident - a topic that Republicans have been using to blast the Biden administration as ""irresponsible"" - but on the other hand, continuing to shoot down unidentified objects exposes its vulnerable mindset, and the US government should be transparent on what those objects that could pose potential risks to civil aviation are. ""The US is now very vulnerable in its sense of security and has showed growing anxiety, driving it to shoot down aerial objects one after another,"" Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday. However, while it has yet to clearly state where those objects come from, US public opinion will connect the moves with the Chinese balloon, which also shows that their perception of China has become more negative in the country, and the Biden administration has become less flexible in its China policy, Li said. ""This reduction in flexibility makes any possible improvement in China-US ties very difficult.""The US Navy and Marine Corps are holding joint exercises in the South China Sea at a time of heightened tensions between China and the US over the balloon incident, the AP reported on Monday. The 7th Fleet based in Japan said Sunday that the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group and the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit have been conducting ""integrated expeditionary strike force operations"" in the South China Sea, the media report said. Also on Sunday, media reported that local maritime authorities in East China's Shandong Province had spotted an unidentified flying object in waters near the coastal city of Rizhao in the province, and were preparing to shoot it down. In response to a question regarding the report, Wang said ""the relevant Chinese department has released the notice. I would refer you to the relevant department.""When asked about how China will react if another US balloon flies into Chinese airspace again, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Monday that China reserves the right to use any necessary means to deal with similar situations. ""No country can guarantee that similar accidents will not happen.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry said that they shared the view that Japan and Australia need to “lead efforts toward the realization of a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" referring to a vision that Japan has been promoting along with the US to counter China, Japanese media reported.The Friday talks, which followed a similar meeting in Washington between US and Australian defense and foreign ministers, aimed to put the consensus reached in Washington into action and further assign missions for Japan and Australia, two spearheads of the US in pushing its Indo-Pacific Strategy, Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Center at East China Normal University, told the Global Times.The ""2+2"" ministerial consultations between the US and Australia were held on Tuesday, and the two countries agreed to increase the rotational presence of US forces in Australia and to ""invite Japan to integrate into our force posture initiatives in Australia,"" media reported. The US and Australia referred to Japan with the purpose of emphasizing coordination between Japan and Australia, particularly in their militaries, and they also wanted to bring Japan into their military cooperation, particularly in joint drills to better prepare for any military clashes in the Indo-Pacific area, Chen said.In recent years, Australia and Japan have worked to strengthen their cooperation. For example, in October, Japan and Australia signed a new bilateral security agreement covering military, intelligence, cybersecurity and space cooperation, a move that experts said shows the two countries' willingness to be pawns of the US, while threatening regional peace and security.Chen said that no matter how loud Japan and Australia tout a “free” Indo-Pacific, the two countries are actually trying to join forces and exert their influence in Southeast Asian and Pacific Island countries to help the US contain China and stir up trouble in the region, for example, in the South China Sea or on the Taiwan question.Chen noted that there will be more interactions between Australia and Japan in the coming year, as the two have become a de facto military alliance after signing a Reciprocal Access Agreement. It is also possible that Japan will join the Five Eyes Alliance, an intelligence grouping comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US, and AUKUS, the trilateral security pact between the US, UK and Australia. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a speech in Tokyo that Australia will push for Japan to be included as a quasi fourth member of AUKUS as it seeks to elevate its partnership with Tokyo to unprecedented heights, media reported.The Australian government has combined adventurism with opportunism and chosen to defend US hegemony at the cost of its own national interests and security, which reveals its lack of prudence and political wisdom, said Chen. Analysts also warned that Japan is using cooperation with Australia and other countries to seek to lift its military restrictions, while the rise of conservative forces in Japan and the Japanese government’s hyping of the Taiwan question have also alarmed many Asian countries. A small group of countries are using “free” and “open” as excuses to stir up confrontations and clashes, severely threatening the hard-won peace in Asia, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Kong Xuanyou said in a forum on Thursday, calling on Japan to maintain strategic independence to make the right choice and defend the overall and long-term interests in Asia.                          "

However, observers say whether this event will meet the various demands for development of different African countries remains unclear, and no matter how many fancy words the US uses, the country still sees Africa as an arena to serve its strategic goal of competing with China.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-13/cf16c202-abe4-476b-9e44-504bf77a90ba.jpg,"  Claiming to be closing a growing trust gap with Africa, US President Joe Biden will host 50 leaders from African countries and the African Union for a summit from Tuesday. However, observers say whether this event will meet the various demands for development of different African countries remains unclear, and no matter how many fancy words the US uses, the country still sees Africa as an arena to serve its strategic goal of competing with China.Fifty African leaders will reportedly attend the three-day US-Africa Leaders Summit, which begins on Tuesday and will be the largest foreign meeting in Washington since the COVID-19 pandemic began. Former US president Barack Obama hosted the previous conference between US and African leaders eight years ago.After announcing the event, Biden administration played down their concerns over China’s increasing influence in Africa. When asked about China, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, “This summit is an opportunity to deepen many partnerships we have on the African continent.” The US has been lambasted for not genuinely caring about African development as all of the country’s policies on the continent are predicated on how to defeat imaginary rivals in the region. To win over African leaders, the US agenda for this summit focused on food security, climate change, public health and infrastructure, with US officials attempting to avoid discussing China, Song Wei, professor with institute of international relations with the Beijing Foreign Studies University, told the Global Times. However, whether the US is sincere in assisting African nations' development remains a question, as there are no precise plans for bilateral talks between Biden and African leaders, making it impossible for African countries to present their demands for development to the US, said Song.According to the White House, Biden is set to deliver remarks at a US-Africa business forum, hold small group meetings with leaders, host a leaders’ dinner at the White House and take part in other sessions with leaders during the gathering. No details on bilateral meetings have been disclosed. The US will also work hard to push the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) during the summit to compete with the eye-catching achievements on infrastructure construction made by joint efforts from China and Africa, analysts said. To compete with China, the US has put forward its own proposals for infrastructural development in Africa, but has no edge in terms of funding and implementation, not to mention the fact that the US has not fulfilled its prior pledges of aid to Africa. Considering the enormous demand for infrastructure building, African countries expect little from the US, said Song. After four years of former US president Donald Trump's ""America First"" foreign policy, Biden has spent most of his first two years in office attempting to alleviate world doubts about American leadership and is now paying more attention to Africa. For example, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited the continent in August and in the same month, the Biden administration unveiled its sub-Saharan African strategy. Unlike earlier plans, the Sub-Saharan African strategy noted that Africa's votes are essential to US interests, indicating that while taking a competitive approach to global affairs, the US is seeking to bring Africa into its camp. Furthermore, its choice to support the African Union's membership in the G20 also has a strategic competitive purpose, since China, Indonesia, and many other developing nations have already voiced support, said Song.The US' increasing interest in Africa is primarily motivated by its strategic objective of competing with China on a global scale. The country is also replicating China's cooperation mechanism with African leaders by organizing a similar US-Africa summit. However, African countries are finding it difficult to have any confidence in the US, given its disrespectful attitude toward the continent, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times.For example, Trump's racist remarks against several African countries in January 2018 sparked outrage and protests across the continent. Biden is not Trump, but as a weak administration, it is unclear to what degree his administration’s African initiatives will be executed or continued. The inconsistency of US' policy toward Africa makes it more difficult to gain the trust of African leaders, Li said. The US' current policies are protectionist, and it exploits resources across the world to boost its own prosperity. In light of this, how can African countries believe the US' promises? The expert asked. “And given what the US has done in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other parts of the world over the last 30 years, African leaders are wise enough not to be misled by the US,” he added.Many African scholars have increasingly criticized the US for not truly caring about the continent's development, but only using it to serve its geopolitical strategy, and the purpose of this summit is not to make Africa better but to make the US better.                          "

And the current quarantine policy will be optimized to only three days of home quarantine. China will further optimize and facilitate the cross-border travels in accordance to the epidemic situation, said Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, at a routine press conference on Thursday.Lee recently pointed out that it is possible that Hong Kong and the mainland will realize quarantine-free travel next year.After the mainland recently unveiled a new 10-point plan to optimize its COVID-19 response, the HKSAR government has been in discussions with Shenzhen and South China's Guangdong Province on the matter of resumption of travel, according to media reports. Thousands of customs, immigration and police officers will be sent to checkpoints to manage a predicted surge in traffic as the border between Hong Kong and the mainland is expected to fully reopen next month, according to media reports. Staff used to work at Lo Wu, Lok Ma Chau Station and  who have been transferred to other stations due to the suspension of port operations were recently recalled to their posts, Wei Wen Po said, further hinting that normal operations may not be far away. Any easing of restrictions along the border with the mainland should be done gradually to prevent a wave of COVID-19 infections, the South China Morning Post said on Thursday, citing health experts and politicians.Government health adviser Professor David Hui Shu-cheong on Wednesday suggested implementing a triple-jab requirement for all inbound travelers and a daily quota for those coming from the mainland to reduce the risk of infections and safeguarding the public healthcare system, the SCMP said.                          "

He also emphasized that the city would fully cooperate with the mainland in epidemic prevention and control. After the mainland recently unveiled a new 10-point plan to optimize its COVID-19 response, the HKSAR government talked with Shenzhen and South China's Guangdong Province on the matter of resumption of travel, according to media reports. Thousands of customs, immigration and police officers will be sent to checkpoints to manage a predicted surge in traffic as the border between Hong Kong and the mainland is expected to fully reopen next month, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Friday.When asked about whether Lee would talk about quarantine-free arrangements for cross-border travel and will there be ""good news"" before Spring Festival in January, Lee said on Tuesday that he would report Hong Kong's situation to the central government and express the willingness to fully cooperate with the mainland's policies. ""Lee's official debriefing and visit to Beijing is a discharge of his duties as a chief executive. He holds his office on a dual accountability basis, to the central government and the HKSAR,"" Chu Kar-kin, a veteran current affairs commentator based in Hong Kong and member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies, told the Global Times on Tuesday. He may convey the HKSAR's wishes for a quick removal or adjustment to the quarantine measures for entering the mainland checkpoints and other favorable policy incentives for a comprehensive economic recovery in the pandemic's aftermath, Chu said. ""We also expect our CE is going to report to the leadership that the elections were held successfully and implementation of the constitutional reform is smooth so far,"" he said. Lau Siu-kai, deputy head of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies who is also a senior policy advisor, told local media in Hong Kong that the CE's annual work report reflects the institutional arrangement under which the CE is responsible to the central government. Lau believed that since taking office, Lee made progress in handling the land and housing issue, improving local governance and promoting national education, which would all be affirmed by the top leaders. Over the past few years, the city has consolidated its achievements in restoring order, and the situation has constantly improved as the central government brought up new requirements for the local governance team. Lee delivered his first policy address in mid-October, highlighting the need to improve local governance, enhance the city's competitiveness as an international business hub, attract more talented professionals and fix social and economic woes, as the city embarks on a new journey under the One Country, Two Systems. Also, President Xi's earlier visit to the city on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and his speech were the blueprint for Lee's policy address, Lee said, noting that the city is now at the critical stage of transitioning from chaos to order and prosperity, and he will lead the governing team to work on the city's growth plan.Another matter of concern during the duty report trip is whether Lee would bring up his earlier request to the central government for an interpretation of the national security case of media tycoon Jimmy Lai Chee-ying, following a top court in the city allowing an overseas barrister to defend him. Lee said the central government's three institutions in Hong Kong supported the law's interpretation by the National People's Congress - China's top legislature - and hopefully, the central government will soon make a decision on the matter, he told the press conference on Tuesday. The NPC Standing Committee is set to meet from December 27 to 30, but the interpretation of the national security law is not on the public agenda, and Lai's trial has been adjourned to September next year, the SCMP said.                           "

De-globalization and the voluntary restriction to a few trading partners are not a good recipe for the future of the world, he noted.This is not the first time Scholz has expressed similar views. China’s rise is neither a reason to isolate China nor an excuse to limit cooperation with China, Scholz said in an editorial published recently on the website of US international relations magazine Foreign Affairs, adding that he does not agree with the idea that the world is entering a new Cold War between China and the US.China is a growing force for world peace and provides opportunities for global development, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on December 6 in response to Scholz’s remarks, sadding that isolating China and restricting cooperation with China serve no one’s interests.China is deeply integrated with the global economy and international system, and the world will not retreat to a state of mutual closure and separation. Any move toward decoupling and bloc confrontation will harm others without benefiting oneself, Mao added.In early November, Scholz paid a short but meaningful visit to Beijing, agreeing on enhanced dialogue and cooperation and rejecting decoupling and bloc confrontation. As the first European leader to visit China after the 20th Communist Party of China National Congress and the first G7 leader to visit the country since the outbreak of COVID-19, Scholz has faced mounting pressure from some German and European politicians, and in particular from Washington.Germany's national interests are diversified, and the German government has a clear attitude that it cannot bet its future on only one or a small handful of countries, Sun Keqin, a research fellow at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times.The Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused obvious and long-term damage to Germany, while the economic and trade cooperation between China and Germany can continue to inject momentum into the German economy. Germans are clearly aware that globalization and diversification are the fundamental guarantee for the vitality of their economy, Sun noted.The year 2022 marks the 50th anniversary of the founding of China-Germany diplomatic relations. The sound development of bilateral relations in the past has been a good example of seeking common ground while shelving differences and pursuing win-win cooperation, analysts said.An important reason that Germany cannot easily decouple from China is that Germany plays a pivotal role in global governance and bilateral relations, and decoupling from China is not in the fundamental interests of Germany, Sun explained.Many Chinese experts who have observed China-EU relations for a long time said there is great potential for China and Europe to develop bilateral relations and negotiate and manage global issues. Despite differences in values and social systems, the China-EU cooperation can still be maximized by managing and resolving differences and conflicts step by step.At the same time, experts expressed their appreciation and welcoming of the rational views on China held by many European leaders, including Scholz, and said that it is very important for European leaders not to misjudge the opportunities created by China's rise.

The following is the full text of the address:Greetings to you all. The year 2023 is approaching. From Beijing, I extend my best New Year wishes to all of you.In 2022, we successfully convened the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.The Chinese economy has remained the second largest in the world and enjoyed sound development. GDP for the whole year is expected to exceed 120 trillion yuan. Despite a global food crisis, we have secured a bumper harvest for the 19th year in a row, putting us in a stronger position to ensure the food supply of the Chinese people. We have consolidated our gains in poverty elimination and advanced rural revitalization across the board. We have introduced tax and fee cuts and other measures to ease the burden on businesses, and made active efforts to solve the most pressing difficulties of high concern to the people.Since COVID-19 struck, we have put the people first and put life first all along. Following a science-based and targeted approach, we have adapted our COVID response in light of the evolving situation to protect the life and health of the people to the greatest extent possible. Officials and the general public, particularly medical professionals and community workers, have bravely stuck to their posts through it all. With extraordinary efforts, we have prevailed over unprecedented difficulties and challenges, and it has not been an easy journey for anyone. We have now entered a new phase of COVID response where tough challenges remain. Everyone is holding on with great fortitude, and the light of hope is right in front of us. Let's make an extra effort to pull through, as perseverance and solidarity mean victory.Comrade Jiang Zemin passed away in 2022. We pay high tribute to his towering achievements and noble demeanor, and cherish the great legacy he left behind. We will honor his last wishes and advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.Wave upon wave, the mighty river of history surges forward. With the persistent efforts of one generation after another, we have taken China to where it is today.Today's China is a country where dreams become reality. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games concluded with a resounding success. Chinese winter sports athletes gave their all and achieved extraordinary results. Shenzhou-13, Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 soared into the heavens. China's space station was fully completed and our ""home in space"" is roving in the deep-blue sky. The people's armed forces marked the 95th birthday and all service members are marching confidently on the great journey of building a strong military. China's third aircraft carrier Fujian was launched. C919, China's first large passenger aircraft, was delivered. And the Baihetan hydropower station went into full operation... None of these achievements would have been possible without the sweat and toil of the numerous Chinese people. Sparks of talent are coming together, and they are the strength of China!Today's China is a country brimming with vigor and vitality. Various pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port are booming, innovations are gushing out in the coastal areas, development is picking up pace in the central and western regions, the momentum for revitalization is building in the northeast, and there is greater development and affluence in the border regions. The Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality. The fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong. As long as we stay confident and strive for progress while maintaining stability, we will realize the goals we have set. On my visit to Hong Kong earlier this year, I was deeply glad to see that Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive again. With determined implementation of One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong and Macao will surely enjoy long-term prosperity and stability.Today's China is a country that keeps to its national character. In the course of 2022, we encountered various natural disasters including earthquakes, floods, droughts and wildfires, and experienced some workplace accidents. Amid those disconcerting and heartbreaking scenes, there have emerged numerous touching stories of people sticking together in face of adversity or even sacrificing their lives to help others in distress. Those heroic deeds will be forever etched in our memories. At every turn of the year, we always think of the great character of resilience that the Chinese nation has carried forward through millennia. It gives us still greater confidence as we continue our way forward.Today's China is a country closely linked with the world. Over the past year, I have hosted quite a few friends, both old and new, in Beijing; I have also traveled abroad to communicate China's propositions to the world. Changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace, and the world is not yet a tranquil place. We cherish peace and development and value friends and partners as we have always done. We stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human civilization and progress. We work hard to contribute China's wisdom and solutions to the cause of peace and development for all humanity.After the 20th CPC National Congress, my colleagues and I visited Yan'an. We were there to relive the inspiring episode in which the Party's central leadership overcame extraordinary difficulties in the 1930s and 1940s, and to draw on the spiritual strength of the older generation of CPC members. I often say, ""Just as polishing makes jade finer, adversity makes one stronger."" Over the past 100 years, the CPC has braved wind and rain, and forged ahead against all odds. That is a most difficult yet great journey. Today, we must press on courageously to make tomorrow's China a better place.Going forward, China will be a country that performs miracles through hard work. Here I want to quote Su Shi, a renowned Chinese poet, ""Charge at the toughest and aim at the farthest."" It means to take on the biggest challenges and go after the most ambitious goals. Long as the journey is, we will reach our destination if we stay the course; difficult as the task is, we will get the job done if we keep working at it. As long as we have the resolve to move mountains and the perseverance to plod on, as long as we keep our feet on the ground and forge ahead with our journey by making steady progress, we will turn our grand goals into reality.Going forward, China will be a country that draws its strength from unity. Ours is a big country. It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue. What matters is that we build consensus through communication and consultation. When the 1.4 billion Chinese work with one heart and one mind, and stand in unity with a strong will, no task will be impossible and no difficulty insurmountable. The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are members of one and the same family. I sincerely hope that our compatriots on both sides of the Strait will work together with a unity of purpose to jointly foster lasting prosperity of the Chinese nation.Going forward, China will be a country that has great expectations of its younger generation. A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive. For China to develop further, our young people must step forward and take on their responsibilities. Youth is full of vigor and is a source of hope. Youngsters should keep their country in mind, cultivate keen enterprise, and live youth to the fullest with great drive, to prove worthy of the times and the splendor of youth.To the many people who are still busy working at this very moment, I salute you all! We are about to ring in the New Year. Let us welcome the first ray of sunshine of 2023 with the best wishes for a brighter future.May our country enjoy prosperity and our people live in harmony. May the world enjoy peace and people of all countries live in happiness. I wish you all a happy New Year and may all your wishes come true.Thank you.                         "

The COVID response has shifted focus from preventing infections to preventing critical cases and deaths, which is a realistic and practical approach in facing the new reality of contagion. The great efforts made over the past three years and achievements of an overall sound control of infections are realized by national solidarity. Recently, many people have already become infected and recovered. Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations from the China Foreign Affairs University, said although there are challenges and difficulties lying ahead, ""we have already demonstrated our perseverance, and we will achieve the ultimate victory against the epidemic."" Many places have bravely pulled through and emerged from the first peak of infections after adopting the new COVID response strategy, observers said, citing the return of traffic jams, and crowds in shopping malls in major cities. Amid the 2023 New Year's Day holiday and Spring Festival holiday, the country has been gearing up to cope with potential infections peak and minimize its impact on rural areas where medical resources are relatively scarce. It is widely acknowledged that China's overall COVID response has been responsible and successful over the past three years, saving an untold number of lives especially at the initial stage when the virus strain was more lethal. In face of the new reality, there have been many debates and divergent views. Li noted at this crucial juncture, every Chinese should not allow Western attacks to disturb our new pace and undermine our confidence in such a victory. More importantly, ""we should stand firmly together to overcome the new challenges.""  Xi, in the address, underlined the importance of solidarity, saying ""Going forward, China will be a country that draws its strength from unity.""""Ours is a big country.

The certificate shall be binding on the courts, according to the Article 47 of the NSL for Hong Kong.The proposal made by John Lee, CE of the HKSAR, on November 28 concerning the overseas lawyers without full qualifications for practicing in the HKSAR would trigger national security risks. The matter falls under Article 47, which requires a certificate issued by the CE.If Hong Kong courts do not obtain a certificate from the CE, the committee shall perform its duties and take decisions on the relevant situation and questions in accordance to the Article 14, according to the NPC.Lee submitted a report to the central government mentioning the case of Lai in late November suggesting that the NPC Standing Committee should interpret the NSL for Hong Kong to clarify whether a lawyer without local full qualifications can handle national security cases after the city's top court rejected an appeal by the Department of Justice to overturn the permission to allow London-based King's Counsel Timothy Owen to represent Lai, which is seen as a disappointing ruling.An official from the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the NPC said the law interpretation came as Hong Kong society faces huge divergence in practicing the NSL for Hong Kong. It is necessary to ensure the correct and effective implementation of the NSL for Hong Kong and effectively safeguard the constitutional order of HKSAR established by the Constitution and the Basic Law, the official said.Since the city's return to the motherland, Hong Kong has seen six instances of law interpretations from China's top legislature, including the latest one on Friday,, according to media reports.Article 65 of the NSL for Hong Kong also stipulates that the power of interpretation shall be vested in the Standing Committee of the NPC.The NPC Standing Committee has interpreted the Basic Law for five times, forming a relatively mature law interpretation experience and practice, which has been familiar to all sectors of Hong Kong society and has been generally recognized, the official said.The law interpretation is to solve legal problems that are difficult to solve at the level of the HKSAR, clearing off the confusion and ending the conflicts, which serves to ""set the tone,"" the official said, noting that the law interpretation has become a major part of the SAR's legal system.""The NPC's law interpretation actually allows the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR to take the ultimate responsibility in Hong Kong to ensure that the lawyers involved in the trial of national security cases are people who can loyally safeguard national security and keep state secrets,"" Lau Siu-kai, a consultant from the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies who is also a senior policy advisor, told the Global Times on Friday.The law interpretation once again shows that the central government actively exercised its overall governance to fully and accurately implement the One Country, Two Systems principle, Lau added.The Constitution and the Basic Law together constitute the constitutional basis of the HKSAR.The Standing Committee of the NPC does not directly deal with specific judicial cases, which is different from judicial interpretations made by judicial organs in the trial of specific cases, the official said. The law interpretation by the top legislature is conducive to clarifying the meaning of the relevant legal provisions, properly solving major disputes encountered in the implementation of the NSL for Hong Kong and playing a positive role for Hong Kong residents to choose lawyers and for the HKSAR to correctly exercise independent judicial power and power of final adjudication.""There is no undermining of the high degree of the autonomy of the HKSAR,"" the official said.Local authorities in Hong Kong welcomed the latest move. Hong Kong's judiciary said on Friday night that it respects the lawful exercise of power by the Standing Committee of the NPC to make legally binding interpretations of Articles 14 and 47 of the NSL regarding the HKSAR's performance of its duties in safeguarding national security.The judiciary will, as required by Article 3 of the NSL for Hong Kong, continue to effectively prevent, suppress and impose punishment for any act or activity endangering national security in accordance with law, according to a statement.Lee also thanked and welcomed the matter, saying that the Committee and the HKSAR government will fully assume the responsibilities explained in the law interpretation, especially on whether hiring a foreign lawyer for a national security case will involve national security risks.The HKSAR government will implement the judgments and decisions made by the Committee on relevant issues, and actively consider proposing amendments to the Legal Practitioners Ordinance, Lee said.""Lai's case involved colluding with external forces, engaging in anti-China activities and disrupting order in Hong Kong, which seriously threatens national security and allowing him to hire a foreign lawyer is very inappropriate,"" Louis Chen, member of the Election Committee and general secretary of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, told the Global Times on Friday.The recent legal disputes showed that some people in Hong Kong's legal and judicial sectors still do not fully understand and lack compliance with the relevant provisions of the Basic Law. The law interpretation effectively plugged the loopholes of the legal system, echoing the expectations of Hong Kong society, Chen noted.""As the chairperson of the committee, the CE should be deeply involved in the implementation of national security law and the interpretation puts forward the concept of the certification from the CE, confirming the CE's responsibilities in implementing the NSL for Hong Kong,"" he said.Foreign lawyers are welcomed to take part in cases not involving endangering national security, and no matter how amendments to be made, they won't affect foreign lawyers who obtain specific permissions approved by local courts in taking part in non-national security cases in the future, Lee told reporters on Friday evening, stressing that the law interpretation this time targets specific scope.

Many netizens reposted highlights from Xi's address to commemorate the year of 2022, with even more leaving their best wishes for the country and calling for people to embrace a brighter 2023. ""The year 2023 is approaching. From Beijing, I extend my best New Year wishes to all of you,"" President Xi said at the beginning of his address. Then he noted that convening of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China has sounded a clarion call of the times for the Chinese people forging ahead on a new journey.An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, he said.President Xi hailed China's achievements on social and economic developments, military advancement and major projects as well as the successful hosting of the Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics in 2022. ""None of these achievements would have been possible without the sweat and toil of the Chinese people. Sparks of talent are coming together, and they are the strength of China!"" Xi said.  As prevention and control of COVID-19 had been a key topic for Chinese in 2022, President Xi also addressed the Chinese people's fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. ""Since COVID-19 struck, we have put the people first and put life first all along. Following a science-based and targeted approach, we have adapted our COVID response in light of the evolving situation to protect the life and health of the people to the greatest extent possible,"" Xi said.With extraordinary efforts, we have prevailed over unprecedented difficulties and challenges, and it has not been an easy journey for anyone, said Xi, noting that ""We have now entered a new phase of COVID response where tough challenges remain"". ""Everyone is holding on with great fortitude, and the light of hope is right in front of us. Let's make an extra effort to pull through, as perseverance and solidarity mean victory,"" Xi said.China has faced a complicated and challenging year in 2022 and finally made it to the end with the efforts of every Chinese citizen. President Xi's New Year address demonstrated the changes the Chinese society has experienced and showed the Chinese leader's deep care for the Chinese people, Zhang Yiwu, a professor of Peking University, told the Global Times. After three years' hard efforts to keep COVID-19 at bay, China has gradually optimized its virus response in 2022 and implemented a major shift in its epidemic policy by downgrading COVID management and announcing the reopening of international borders from January 8, 2023. The crucial step has paved the way for China to gradually walk out of the epidemic and fully integrate with the world. President Xi's words reflecting on everyone holding with great fortitude also impressed Chinese netizens with many recalling the collective striving of the country in the fight against COVID-19 and the sacrifice of medical workers and people working across all sectors of society and expressed their wishes for the country to overcome the current epidemic wave. ""Every Chinese is the hero in 2022 and our country has also been a hero. We are ready to usher in a new year in 2023 with our motherland and wish our country to enjoy long-term prosperity,"" wrote one netizen. ""Unity"" is also a key word in President Xi's speech, stressing that China will be a country that draws its strength from unity. ""Ours is a big country. It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue. What matters is that we build consensus through communication and consultation. When the 1.4 billion Chinese work with one heart and one mind, and stand in unity with a strong will, no task will be impossible and no difficulty insurmountable,"" Xi said.As the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are members of one and the same family, President Xi also expressed sincere hope that ""our compatriots on both sides of the Strait will work together with a unity of purpose to jointly foster lasting prosperity of the Chinese nation.""Xi also mentioned his trip to Hong Kong in 2022, saying that he ""was deeply glad to see that Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive again. With determined implementation of One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong and Macao will surely enjoy long-term prosperity and stability.""The Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality. The fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong. As long as we stay confident and strive for progress while maintaining stability, we will realize the goals we have set, said Xi.The core of President Xi's New Year address was to unite the Chinese people and inspire them to have more confidence to embrace a brighter future, Li Haidong, a professor from the Institute of International Relations from the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Saturday.This year's New Year address underscored that the destiny of every Chinese is closely linked to the destiny of the country and with the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, we Chinese people can overcome all difficulties and challenges, Li added.The expert noted that Xi's address also sent a message to the outside world that China is a country brimming with vigor and vitality and China's development will inject more stability and certainty into the world as China closely links with those beyond its borders.Li Changan, a professor from the University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times on Saturday that Xi's address will instill confidence in the Chinese society, as it faces new opportunities following the conclusion of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).""Cohesion and confidence are the two vital elements for the people about to embark on a new journey and ensure the journey is a success,"" Li Changan said, noting that external uncertainty and the fight against the COVID following the optimization of the epidemic control measures also makes cohesion a prerequisite for China to focus on domestic development.

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-02/5a2882c4-f8a3-4da1-b53e-40e55ffdfeb7.jpeg," Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers' Party (PT) was sworn in as president of Brazil for a four-year term - the third time he has held the country's highest office - on Sunday, with a high-level Chinese delegation led by Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative Vice President Wang Qishan attending the presidential inauguration. The Chinese delegation led by the vice president shows that China attaches great importance to the comprehensive strategic partnership with Brazil, Chinese observers said, noting that under the ""old friend"" Lula's presidency, mutual political trust, comprehensive cooperation and overall relations between the two countries are expected to be brought to a higher level.This is Lula's third presidential term and his return to power comes after having spent more than a year in prison between 2018 and 2019, due to a controversial sentence that was later annulled by the Supreme Court.In October, Lula was elected president with 60.3 million votes, or 50.9 percent of the vote, while then President Jair Bolsonaro obtained 58.2 million votes or 49.1 percent. After the elections, the president-elect stressed in recent weeks that he will govern for everyone and that it is necessary to unite the country.Lula's presidential inauguration attracted floods of his supporters gathering in front of Congress early in the morning - decked out in the red color of his Workers' Party. They traveled to see their leader sworn in - but also for a celebration, according to media reports.The Chinese delegation led by Wang Qishan attended the presidential inauguration on Sunday at the invitation of the Brazilian government, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.The Chinese vice president's trip speaks to the high importance China attaches to Brazil and bilateral relations, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for the ministry said on Thursday. ""We believe this visit will give a strong boost to our comprehensive strategic partnership and bring it to new heights, delivering more benefits for both countries and peoples and contributing to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity,"" the spokesperson said.According to Reuters, Lula is expected to make official trips to China, the US and Argentina in his first three months in office, Foreign Relations Minister Mauro Vieira said in December 2022.Wang Youming, director of the institute of developing countries at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, predicted that under China's old friend's presidency, economic and trade cooperation between China and Brazil will be further deepened, which will help ease Brazil's predicament of high inflation and low economic growth. Mutual trust between China and Brazil on bilateral cooperation under the framework of the emerging-market bloc BRICS, as well as cooperation on economic and trade, environmental protection, the green economy and other fields is anticipated to be brought to a higher level, the observer said.Chinese observers believe that China is expected to forge deeper ties with Latin America. Left-wing regimes in Latin America usually ""pull away"" from the US and advocate a diversified and balanced diplomacy, while right-wing regimes, although economically dependent on China, prefer to maintain close relations with North America, Europe and other countries in a more traditional way. The veteran left-wing politician's presidency in Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, will lead a growing left-wing tide in Latin America toward a new peak, marking a fundamental change in the political landscape across the continent, observers believe.In this context, the international environment of leftist countries such as Cuba and Venezuela will improve in the future, and the autonomy of Latin American diplomacy will be greatly enhanced. All these mean that it will be more difficult for the US to find a ""fulcrum"" for its ""differentiation and disintegration"" policy toward Latin America, they noted.Wang Youming said Lula would pursue a moderate diplomatic line and adopt a strategy of balance between great powers.Apart from diplomatic issues, the observer pointed out that the biggest challenge Lula faces is the current divisions in Brazilian society between left and right, and the prominent confrontation between different social camps.On top of that, Lula will have to deal with political strife in Congress, where pushing through reforms in a right-wing-majority Congress will test the Lula administration's capabilities, Wang Youming added.Brazil has created three ""firsts"" in its ties with China: the first developing country to establish strategic partnership with China; the first Latin American country to establish comprehensive strategic partnership with China; and the first Latin American country whose bilateral trade volume with China broke the $100 billion mark. Long-term friendship between China and Brazil, deepening mutually beneficial cooperation is in the fundamental interests of the two countries and two peoples, and is conducive to maintaining regional and global peace and stability, promoting common development and prosperity. We congratulate Lula on his election victory, and look forward to further development of China-Brazil friendship.                         "

Tam Yiu-chung, a member of the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC) from Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Saturday that the interpretation of the provisions of the NSL for Hong Kong further clarified the special status and important responsibilities of the HKSAR in solving national security issues, further making it clear the legislative intent of the NSL for Hong Kong and providing a mechanism to solve similar problems in the future. ""The law interpretation could help clarify which legal professionals could involve in national security cases and prevent any potential risks, dispelling concerns over the possible interference of foreign forces in Hong Kong affairs and in endangering the national security,"" Tam said. Article 14 of the NSL for Hong Kong stipulates the duties and functions of the Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the HKSAR, while Article 47 stipulates that the courts of the HKSAR shall obtain a certificate from the CE to certify whether an act involves national security or whether the relevant evidence involves state secrets when such questions arise in the adjudication of a case.""When a court hears a case related to the NSL for Hong Kong, it needs to ask the CE and obtain a certificate from the CE when it encounters the issue of whether the relevant act involves national security or whether the relevant material involves state secrets,"" Willy Fu, a law professor and vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Legal Exchange Foundation, told the Global Times on Saturday. The certificate is issued based on analysis of facts, evidence and in accordance to the law, which is fair and justified, creating a positive effects on the HKSAR's correct exercise of independent judicial power and final adjudication power in line with the law, and there's no such thing of damaging the high degree autonomy of the HKSAR, Fu said. Some Western media outlets such as the Wall Street Journal and Nikkei criticized the legal interpretation by claiming that the top authority ""lets Hong Kong leader override courts over Jimmy Lai's lawyer,"" and ""devastates the remaining degree of rule of law and judicial independence of Hong Kong."" However, legal professionals in Hong Kong believed that those media have not fully grasped the essence of the Constitution, the Basic Law and the NSL for Hong Kong, which is the ill-intentioned slander that should be strongly condemned. ""The law interpretation does not mean the administration has the power to interfere in or change the court's ruling.

For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said recently that from January 5, travelers boarding flights to the US from the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macao would need a negative COVID-19 test or proof they had recovered from a previous infection. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Tuesday that this approach lacks scientific basis and some practices are unacceptable targeting only Chinese travelers, adding that the country will take corresponding measures in response to varying situations based on the principle of reciprocity.Over the past three years, China has conducted more than 60 technical exchanges with the WHO, including two since the release of the new epidemic management policy, Mao said, noting that China continues to share the genome data of the virus via the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). The Chinese government has taken responsible policies and measures, done its best and made important contributions to protecting Chinese people’s lives and health and promoting global solidarity against the pandemic and world economic recovery and growth, Mao added.Mao also reiterated China stands ready to step up communication with the rest of the international community and work together to prevail over COVID.

The one-China principle is a universal consensus respected by the international community and a basic norm in international relations. The communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries clearly states that the Republic of Korea (ROK) recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and respects the Chinese position that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of China, the spokesperson said.""We firmly oppose any form of official interaction between South Korea and China's Taiwan region,"" the spokesperson said.The biggest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits is the separatist activities pushed forward by ""Taiwan independence"" secessionist forces and the illegal connivance of some external forces, the spokesperson noted.The National Assembly of South Korea plays an important role in the political and social life of South Korea.

""The visit will focus on support from the democratic world for Taiwan and closer EU-Taiwan relations,"" it said.However, observers contend that Rasmussen's intention is to drive European countries to gain favor with the island of Taiwan, enhance the status and influence of the island in international affairs to achieve the purpose of cooperating with the US.As a former NATO Secretary General, Rasmussen's visit to Taiwan island is a case of European politicians colluding with the US to play the Taiwan card and create more severe obstacles and challenges for China's internal and external development environment, Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.Such an approach, in fact, coincides with the US' strategy of encouraging its allies to make a big fuss over the Taiwan question, so that its allies are in the forefront of the overall planning and actions designed by the US for strategic competition and confrontation with China, turning European politicians into pawns, Li noted.""The changes in Taiwan in the intervening 30 years have been immense,"" Rasmussen was quoted as saying in the statement. ""Taiwan's democratic transformation would be impressive under any circumstances. The fact that it has happened while facing daily threats and provocations from a nuclear armed neighbor makes it remarkable.""He also said in the statement that the trip was a chance to ""show his support for Taiwan and its ability to choose its own future freely, peacefully, and independently.""Chinese experts said that ""democracy"" is an example of language that has a certain function in media outlets and in mobilizing people at home. But the real intention of these politicians is not promoting democracy at all, but how to play the Taiwan card to secure the maximum level of approval from the US and create obstacles to China's internal and external development.In 2021, the Alliance of Democracies Foundation held the ""Copenhagen Democracy Summit 2021"" in Denmark, which invited Tsai, Hong Kong separatist Nathan Law, who is also a fugitive suspect, and other ""democratic activists"" worldwide.Observers said that the over the top event was like a platform for ""the alliance of losers"" to beg for more funding from their Western sponsors.At the conference, Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod denounced sanctions imposed by China against the EU in 2021 as ""deplorable.""Responding to such accusations, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said at a press briefing that China had only done the right thing, calling it a necessary and justifiable response to the European Union's unilateral sanctions, which were based on lies that severely undermined China's sovereignty and interests.Democracy should not become a political tool to suppress other countries, and European politicians should understand its real definition and benefit for the masses, Hua said.In the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, so-called democracy has become an excuse to intervene in other countries' affairs, Xin Qiang, deputy director of the Center for American Studies at Fudan University, told the Global Times.In Europe, playing the Taiwan card has become a form of political correctness, and some politicians want to use it as an opportunity to gain political influence without taking any political responsibility, Xin pointed out.Taiwan authorities want to hype up the visit to look for foreign support to seek independence, but they have not realized that they are just a pawn, experts pointed out.It is ironic that European politicians should go to other parts of the world to practice so-called democracy when democracy itself needs saving, Li said.Furthermore, experts warned that as the Taiwan question is a core issue of China's foreign policy, Rasmussen, a relatively influential political figure in Denmark, trying to encourage more people in Denmark and even in Europe to visit the Taiwan island, will inevitably damage the relations between Denmark and China and that peace-loving forces should be alarmed by such actions.

We also noted that many people have said if the US had not politicized the pandemic, and had treated it responsibly and put people's lives first like the Chinese government did, perhaps the COVID situation in the US and the whole world would not have become what it is today.""""We truly hope the focus will be on tackling the virus rather than politicizing the COVID issue, and countries can step up solidarity and make joint efforts to defeat the global pandemic as soon as possible,"" she noted.Some Western media outlets have politicized China's efforts to prevent and control COVID while taking the epidemic as a political tool to defame China.The New York Times, for example, pointed fingers at China in a report on December 27, 2022, claiming that China did little in using three years to bolster its health system and launch vaccination drives targeting millions of vulnerable senior citizens. Such a biased tone is rampant in certain Western media coverage that exaggerated the epidemic crisis in China through exaggerating sensationalist stories, extreme tragic cases in hospitals, and horrific images at crematoria across the country.These narrative and tactics are very familiar to most Chinese people as these rhetoric and tactics have been used in earlier reports that had tarnished China's ""dynamic zero-COVID"" policy before China optimized its policy and eased its epidemic control measures. For example, on November 16, 2022, the New York Times published an article entitled ""What videos show about the extremes of China's 'zero-COVID' policy."" In an attempt to delegitimize and smear China's epidemic control policies, the article stated that the Chinese government had employed extreme measures such as separating children from their parents and enforcing strict punitive measures for violators. In fact, China had used the last three years to learn from the ever-developing global pandemic situation. From 2020 to 2022, China's monthly case fatality rates have seen a drastic decline. What's more, vaccination rates increased over the last three years which has effectively slowed severe morbidity. By December 23, 2022, China's 31 provinces have seen 3.47 billion doses of vaccination administered, with the coverage rate of the whole population exceeding 90 percent, according to domestic media reports.A top official from the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a recent interview that the Chinese government had anticipated increased demand for medical treatment while optimizing epidemic prevention management, and was trying to delay peak infections as much as possible by increasing the availability of fever clinics and related medicines.By contrast, some Western countries, with much more advanced medical systems and being rich in resources, have scored poorly in preventing and controlling their local epidemics if we look at, for instance, the over 1 million death toll in the US attributable to COVID-19. Another risk constantly hyped and exaggerated by Western media is that China's mass infection could create a ""potential breeding ground"" for new variants to emerge.""The fact that 1.4 billion people are suddenly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 obviously creates conditions prone to emerging variants,"" French media France 24 quoted experts as saying. Similarly, the Washington Post portrayed China as ""a threat to the entire world"" because ""it's escalating toll of infections could generate new variants that might be more transmissible or cause more severe disease.""But these accusations turned out to be groundless. China has been closely tracking the new strain. Xu Wenbo, an official at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on December 22, 2022 that hospitals across the country would collect patient samples and upload the sequencing information to a new national database, allowing authorities to monitor possible new strains in real time. Scientifically speaking, the strains currently circulating in China are primarily BA.5.2 and BF.7, which are already prevalent around the world. That means that, as the Washington Post put it, ""Variants can emerge from anywhere."" A particularly aggressive new strain of the Omicron variant, XBB.1.5, is taking hold in New York and the northeast of the US. US CDC models say the XBB variants represent about 40.5 percent of the total infections in the US, according to the Washington Post.Health experts in many countries have said there is no need to impose entry restrictions on travelers from China. Some analysts point out that this is yet another collective political performance by certain countries, who once again want to blame China for the pandemic in order to contain and isolate China.In the last three years since the outbreak of the COVID-19  pandemic, China has made every possible effort to protect the lives and health of the Chinese people while fighting and curbing  various mutations of the virus. From a global perspective, China's severest disease and death rates are among the lowest. Meanwhile, some Western countries buried their heads in the sand early on, unwilling to deal with the reality of COVID-19 when the virus was most ferocious, leading to heavy loss of life. But they tried hard to avoid talking about the heavy price they had paid, and instead repeatedly blame others. In the early stage of the pandemic, when the Chinese people were at the forefront of the valiant fight against the rampant spread of COVID-19, media outlets in the West such as the New York Times (NYT), The Economist, and The Guardian failed to portray the real situation when they should have, but were quick to use underhanded tropes to perpetuate double standards against China's efforts.Some Western media outlets have systematically stigmatized China and created Western political discourse against China. For instance, ""isolation"" is called ""blockade,"" and anyone who praised China's work was termed as ""catering to China.""Let us not forget that some Western media outlets and Western politicians insisted on calling COVID-19 the ""Wuhan virus"" to stigmatize an innocent city and incite racist sentiment against Chinese people around the world.In March 2020, two tweets by NYT posted 20 minutes apart showed how Western media have unashamedly engaged in double standards. The two posts described China and Italy's response to the epidemic - in the first tweet, the NYT Twitter account claimed that China's isolation measures came ""at great cost of people's livelihood and personal liberties""; whereas 20 minutes later, while talking about Italy's similar actions, the newspaper praised it for risking its own economy to stop the spread of what was Europe's worst epidemic at the time.""The measures those [Western] countries have taken were just to stage a political stunt,"" said Shen Yi, a professor at the School of International Relations and Public Affairs of Fudan University. ""Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the performance of these countries was obvious to all. For example, the US, which had advanced medical resources and public health emergency response capacity, scored very poorly in COVID-19 prevention and control,"" he told the Global Times.""If these countries could divert just 1 or 2 percentage points of their thoughts from smearing China, would we have reason to believe that the global fight against COVID-19 would see a light at the end of the tunnel sooner?"" asked Shen. In the political logic of some people in Europe and the US, no matter whether China decides to ""open the door"" or ""close the door,"" it is wrong either way. Some Western media and politicians' opinions change with the wind, analysts said.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, noted that some Western media outlets in fact cooperate and collude with the US government. ""Some Western media are responsible for smearing and attacking China's epidemic control policy no matter what China does.""These media outlets did not report China's epidemic prevention and control measures based on fact but they tried to use it to smear China's international image and weaken China's governance and influence. ""Such behavior can be called a tragedy. But this is reality,"" Li said. ""The US government enlisted some media to use the COVID-19 pandemic as a political tool. So they smeared China's anti-pandemic contributions in China and other parts of the world. They did this to help US gain advantage in an international competition,"" he said. Shen noted that for other countries and regions, they should avoid using China as a scapegoat, and instead, they should have implemented effective COVID-19 control measures. However, the situation looks less rosy at the moment. The U-turn as characterized by certain countries' words and moves related to China's adjustment of epidemic control measures is an all-out sign of a desire to attack China. Meanwhile, China has gained a clear understanding of the post-pandemic situation, as the rest of the world employs electron microscope-level scrutiny as led by American and Western public opinion and anti-China politicians, analysts noted.""If there is a slight flaw, it will be magnified infinitely. If they cannot find a flaw, they will just create one,"" Shen said. ""China's great contributions to the global fight against the pandemic are undeniable. We don't need to listen to those biased and malicious voices,"" he stressed. ""After all, the road is under our own feet.""                         "
Politics,By GT staff reporters  |  2023/1/5 23:50:49,House speaker impasse lays bare failing US democracy,"Two years after the whole world witnessed the failing of US democracy as reflected in the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, more chaos took the stage in Capitol Hill as Republicans in the House of Representatives failed for a second straight day to elect a leader on Wednesday. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-05/f6693323-ee44-4dc0-b305-05f69b87898f.jpeg," Two years after the whole world witnessed the failing of US democracy as reflected in the Capitol riots on January 6, 2021, more chaos took the stage in Capitol Hill as Republicans in the House of Representatives failed for  to elect a leader on Wednesday. A faction of hardline conservatives continued to hold back support for Republican Kevin McCarthy and the day of endless voting ended amid shouting and crowding with the House adjourning for the night.With the eyes of the world seeing the embarrassing scene, which is usually a routine vote at the outset of a legislative session, the polarization and division of US politics and the decline of US democracy are too obvious to hide, and worries have grown as the political radicalization bug may spread to more countries from the US, and the domestic mess may push US politicians into adventurism and bring more uncertainties to the world, analysts said. The once-in-a-century political stalemate continued in the House of Representatives as no progress was made through a sixth round of voting for House speaker on Wednesday.  Twenty conservative holdouts still refuse to support McCarthy, leaving him far short of the 218 typically needed to secure the post of Speaker, a powerful job that is second in the line of succession to the presidency, according to US media reports. Animated private discussions broke out on the chamber floor and in huddled meetings throughout the Capitol between McCarthy supporters and detractors searching for an offramp, The Associated Press  reported. Since the midterm elections, when Republicans gained control of the House, the impasse over McCarthy has gotten worse. The conservative Freedom Caucus in the GOP led the opposition to McCarthy, believing he's neither conservative enough nor tough enough to battle Democrats. Yuan Zheng, deputy director and senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the problem is that McCarthy is disliked by certain far-right Republicans who don't think he's qualified for the job and who don't have faith in him. They want to humiliate McCarthy so that he will make more concessions.Hardline conservatives are vying to be the ""critical minority"" in order to have more power, and this tug-of-war has revealed the divide between many factions inside the GOP since it is unable to choose a convincing leader, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Republicans who don't appreciate McCarthy's chameleon-like behavior in pursuing his own interests in various factions believe he lacks leadership. It's still unclear how an agreement can be reached with those who have refused to back McCarthy, and the impasse might persist for weeks or even months, said Lü.   Faced with the stinging defeat on Wednesday, McCarthy proposed more key concessions in his push to get 218 votes, including agreeing to propose a rules change that would allow just one member to call for a vote to oust a sitting speaker, US media reported. Some Republicans, including former US president Donald Trump, are urging fellow lawmakers to set aside their differences. ""It's now time for all of our GREAT Republican House Members to VOTE FOR KEVIN,"" Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social on Wednesday ahead of the day's votes.But a final deal will not be easy to reach. Lü said that usually, the vote for House speaker seeks the greatest common denominator within one of the two parties in the US, and the current chaotic stalemate showed that the divisions within the Republicans are hard to fix and the mess is more like the prelude to chaos for the 2024 election.Democrats may use this to question Republicans' ability to govern over the coming two years, as they have stumbled at the start of the Congress. However, Lü noted that the division not only exists in the GOP, but also in the Democratic Party, and that even if the Democrats can win control of the House, a similar standoff on the election of a speaker may occur.President Joe Biden, departing the White House for a bipartisan event in Kentucky with Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, said ""the rest of the world is looking"" at the scenes on the House floor. The US President described the standoff as ""embarrassing"" for ""taking so long"" and he has no idea who will prevail, media reported. The leadership fight in the House has provided a dismaying start for the new Republican majority in the House and may affect the Biden administration if the House is paralyzed for a long time and does not pass bills, said Lü. A speaker's election hasn't gone to multiple votes since 1923. Analysts noted that while it is still very likely that McCarthy will eventually succeed in becoming the speaker, the legislative institution will suffer the consequences as the Congress cannot begin its work due to the impasse and lawmakers will be engaged in fierce intra-party struggles and doing battle with the Democrats, therefore paying little attention to the real problems in the US.The US is declining and its two-party system is becoming unsustainable in the upcoming 20 or 30 years with its major challenges, Lü said. Concerns have grown not just in the US but also the rest of the world over the shocking divisions and collapse of US democracy, and many analysts worried that some Western countries could be affected by the US political polarization.   Lü also warned of the risk of a spillover effect from the US domestic chaos, as some politicians may turn to adventurism in their diplomatic policies to either shift domestic attention or to save the face of the US.""We also need to make preparations for any possible risk, whether it's on the Taiwan question or other issues,"" said Lü, noting that possible US provocations will push China to take more firm countermeasures. Yuan noted that it will probably not be easy for McCarthy to do his job after he is elected as the speaker, and it is more likely that he will do something drastic to secure the position. For example, it is highly possible for McCarthy to make a trip to the island of Taiwan - which would show his tough stance and embarrass Biden. China-US relations were impacted after outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a provocative visit to the island of Taiwan in August 2022 and China responded with large-scale military drills around the island in response and took firm countermeasures.

In the 1800-word New Year's message, Song used the word ""peace"" seven times. Song, born in 1955, was announced to have been appointed head of the Taiwan Work Office of the CPC Central Committee and head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday, replacing Liu Jieyi, according to the office's website.Before that, Song served as deputy head of the committee on education, science, health and sports under the 13th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, the country's top political advisory body since June 2022.From November 2015 to June 2022, he served as head of the International Department of the CPC Central Committee.The New Year's message for 2023 is the first New Year's message he has made in new roles. Song said that the Chinese mainland maintained the initiative and ability to steer cross-Strait relations and united compatriots from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to advance cross-Strait ties in 2022.Continued efforts were made in the year to make the historical merits of the Taiwan question and mainland's major principles and policies on work related to Taiwan clear to compatriots in Taiwan and to the international community, said Song.The mainland took concrete measures to support Taiwan compatriots and businesses and help them resolve difficulties, noted Song.China continued the fight against separatist activities and external intervention in affairs regarding Taiwan, effectively deterring external forces who attempted to use Taiwan to contain China, said Song.The results of the new round of local elections on the island have shown that seeking peace, stability, and development are the mainstream public opinion in Taiwan society. The ""Taiwan independence"" secessionists' manipulation of ""resisting China to protect Taiwan"" is unpopular, and ""relying on foreign countries to seek independence"" is doomed to fail, Song said.The Democratic Progressive Party got five out of 21 posts of ""city mayors"" and ""county chiefs"" and the Kuomintang (KMT) grasped 13 in the latest round of elections on the island in late November. In the six ""special municipalities,"" namely New Taipei, Taipei, Taoyuan, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung, four were in the KMT's hands while the DPP kept Tainan and Kaohsiung in the south.  the results were a loud ""No"" of people in the island to DPP authorities' policies on a wide range of topics related to people's livelihoods including the chaotic COVID-19 response and the failure to rein in rising prices, and also demonstrated that Tsai Ing-wen's ""China threat bet"" has backfired.Song listed the efforts the mainland has made in 2022 toward peaceful reunification.The cross-Straits trade and the investment in the mainland from the Taiwan island remained generally stable throughout the year. Some 10 Taiwan companies were listed on the mainland, and the total number of listed companies from the island on the mainland increased to 59. More than 600 key cross-Straits exchange projects, including the 14th Straits Forum, the 2022 annual summit for entrepreneurs across the Taiwan Straits, and the Cross-Straits Youth Summit were successfully held, with more than 100,000 online and offline participants from both sides. Students from the Taiwan island are also actively enrolling in mainland universities, and the number of admissions has increased by 22 percent in 2022 compared with that in 2021.  ""In 2023, we will uphold the policy of peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems and carry out extensive and in-depth discussions on cross-Straits ties and national reunification with people of foresight from various sectors of Taiwan society on the basis of one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus,"" Song said.""We will resolutely defend our national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and take firm action against separatist activities and external intervention,"" Song added.Global Times                         "

Preliminary figures show that since COVID was first reported, the two sides have had over 60 technical exchanges on COVID containment, treatment, vaccine research and development and origins-tracing, Mao said. “We shared the genome sequence of the virus at the earliest opportunity, making important contribution to the drug and vaccine research and development in countries around the world,” Mao said.Recently China’s relevant departments have shared the genome data of the virus from COVID cases in China via the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID), Mao said.On December 9, 2022, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) held a special meeting with the WHO Representative Office in China, during which the NHC informed the WHO of the containment and treatment of the disease in China. On December 30, China and the WHO held another technical exchange meeting on COVID-19 prevention and control during which the two sides exchanged views on the epidemic situation, medical treatment, vaccination and other technical issues. On January 3, at the invitation of the WHO, China dispatched experts from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention to attend a meeting of the WHO Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution, where we provided a comprehensive update on the recent developments and COVID variants in China. On Thursday, WHO will hold a briefing with member states. China has asked relevant experts to attend the meeting where they will further inform the WHO of epidemic containment in China in detail and respond to technical issues that are of concern to other parties, said Mao.The WHO has told China on many occasions that the technical exchanges between China and the WHO have achieved positive results. The information and data provided by China has helped scientists around the world to understand the evolution of the virus and has built confidence among the international scientific community in China’s prevention and control methods, Mao noted.“Facts have proven that China has always maintained close communication with the WHO and shared information and data on the epidemic in a timely, open and transparent manner in accordance with law,” Mao said.The epidemic situation in China is under control. China will continue to conduct technical exchanges and other activities with the WHO amid the adjustment of the epidemic prevention and control policies. It is hoped that the WHO Secretariat will take a science-based, objective and just position and play a positive role in addressing the pandemic globally, Mao said.US President Joe Biden has raised concerns about China’s response to the epidemic. Mao noted that China’s epidemic is under control and China will continue to closely monitor the mutation of the virus, releasing epidemic information in a timely manner and working with the international community to tackle the challenges of the epidemic.The genome data of the virus provided by China’s National Health Commission shows that the predominant variant in China is in line with the genome sequence from travelers from China infected with the virus submitted by other countries, and no new variant or mutation of known significance was noted, according to a WHO release on Wednesday, said Mao.For all countries, COVID response measures need to be science-based and proportionate. They should not be used for political manipulation, there should not be discriminatory measures against China, and measures should not affect normal travel and people-to-people exchange and cooperation, Mao said in response to a question about remarks from WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO chief had said it’s understandable that some countries are taking steps regarding travelers from China as China’s comprehensive data has not been forthcoming. A senior official at the WHO said on Wednesday that “the current numbers being published from China underrepresent the true impact of the disease,” according to the United Nations.                          "

According to a statement released by the Kremlin, the Russian president has instructed his defense minister to introduce a ceasefire along the entire line of contact in Ukraine from 12:00 on Friday to 24:00 Saturday.""As a large number of Orthodox Christians reside in the area of hostilities, we call on the Ukrainian side to declare a ceasefire to allow them to attend church services on Christmas Eve as well as on Christmas Day,"" Putin said in the statement. The announcement came hours after the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill I, called for a ceasefire. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a ceasefire during a phone call with Putin on Thursday.However, Russia's rivals remain skeptical. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky responded on Thursday by saying that Russia wants to use the festival ""as a cover"" to halt Ukrainian advances and use the lull to reinforce its own strength. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak rejected Russia's proposal, calling it ""hypocrisy."" In Washington, US President Joe Biden said Russia is trying to ""find some oxygen"" with the ceasefire announcement. Also on Thursday, the White House announced that the US, along with Germany, will send armored fighting vehicles to Ukraine to boost Kiev's military strength. The US is providing Bradley fighting vehicles, while Germany will send Marder infantry fighting vehicles. The two also agreed to send additional Patriot missile batteries to Ukraine, according to a Financial Times report.France, another US NATO ally, also agreed to supply Ukraine with the AMX-10RC light tank on Wednesday, following talks between French President Emmanuel Macron and Zelensky.Zhang Hong, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that Putin's ceasefire proposal is an unsolicited signal of easing tensions. ""It may be a diplomatic fishing expedition, an attempt to find some conciliatory atmosphere, or to create some kind of goodwill,"" Zhang told the Global Times on Friday.Regarding the negative response from Ukraine and the US, Zhang said the key disagreement in the Ukraine-Russia conflict is over territory, with Russia welcoming peace talks based on the status quo, while Ukraine and the West are demanding a return to the border before 2014.When it comes to the core issues of territory and sovereignty, it is almost impossible for Russia, Ukraine and the West to achieve consensus, said Zhang, ""A brief ceasefire will not change the vast differences in the interests of the parties. And the conditions for the current ceasefire negotiations are far from mature.""Yang Jin, another Eastern European studies expert at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that some European countries no longer import energy from Russia, which is why Germany and France stand in line with the US on military aid to Ukraine.Weapons and vehicles aid from the West will help the Ukraine army narrow its gap with Russia, which means the stalemate on the battlefield will continue, Yang said.

Therefore, the main task in the work of discipline inspection in the future will also focus on dealing with these problems to further improve the governance capability of the CPC.Zhang Xixian, a professor at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday, ""We need to fully implement the Party's decisions and plans of the 20th National Congress of the CPC, but it's also important to oppose mechanically copying or one-sidedly executing the decisions,"" because this may eventually distort and undermine the correctness and effectiveness of the Party's decisions at the grass-roots level. Before the key session of the top Party discipline authority, the downfall of three more senior officials and the release of a new documentary on ex-justice minister  and his corrupt clique signaled the Party's determination and perseverance in fighting corruption in the new journey after the 20th CPC National Congress. The first anti-corruption documentary since the 20th CPC National Congress was aired Saturday by state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV), with the first episode focusing on ex-justice minister  and his corrupt clique led by ex-vice public security minister Sun Lijun, which has drawn widespread attention.Experts said the documentary shows the CPC will maintain high pressure to deter corruption within the Party, and by showing the consequences and lessons of corrupt senior officials, as well as the law-enforcement process, the CPC is trying to keep educating the Party members to be loyal to the Party's central leadership and whole-heartedly respect and follow Party discipline, as well as show the Party's transparency and confidence in its anti-corruption campaign to the public.                          "

Expectedly, it turned into a China-bashing carnival. Some said the country has lost its fight against the pandemic, others said it's a failure of China's political system, while boasting of the superiority of ""democracy"". How do we make sense of China's efforts and sacrifices over the past three years? Let us investigate some of the prevailing false narratives.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-08/2cf07dbd-c760-4027-a631-af50e475a579.jpeg,"  In recent weeks, the Western media's coverage of China has been dominated by news of it refining its COVID-19 policies. Expectedly, it turned into a China-bashing carnival. Some said the country has lost its fight against the pandemic, others said it's a failure of China's political system, while boasting of the superiority of ""democracy"". How do we make sense of China's efforts and sacrifices over the past three years? Let us investigate some of the prevailing false narratives.Some say that China's COVID-19 death toll does not include those who died as a result of delayed or denied medical treatment because of strict COVID-19 control measures. A plausible way to test the validity of such speculation is to compare the country's total deaths during the pandemic and estimated deaths had there been no pandemic. The difference between the two would be the country's excess mortality. According to WHO, between Jan 1, 2020, and Dec 31, 2021, excess mortality in the United States and India was 930,000 and 4.74 million respectively. But China's excess mortality during the pandemic was a negative number, which means China's COVID-19 policy didn't result in excess deaths. On the contrary, fewer Chinese people died because strict disease control measures slowed the spread of the pandemic and also reduced deaths from traffic accidents, alcohol abuse.Because of China's large and aging population, it is inevitable that the virus will lead to more deaths. However, the prevailing Omicron variant is significantly less lethal than the original virus and its Delta variant. More than 90 percent of the Chinese population has been vaccinated, thus putting in place an immunity barrier against the virus. The variety of drugs and rich therapeutic experience now available have significantly reduced the risk of deaths from COVID-19. Therefore, the fact that China is adjusting its COVID-19 policy now instead of one or two years ago is what helped save millions of lives.In the short term, China's COVID-19 prevention and control measures did impact economic growth in some localities. But thanks to its committed policy, China has delivered a way better economic performance than those countries that were swinging between COVID-19 control and laissez-faire. Because China brought the pandemic under control early on, the country was the first major economy in the world to register positive economic growth in 2020, and realize a GDP growth of 8.4 percent year-on-year in 2021, contributing to a quarter of global economic growth and a fifth of world trade. In the first quarter of 2022, China's economy lodged a 4.8 percent year-on-year growth, faster than the global average. With refined COVID-19 measures, according to Morgan Stanley and Nomura Securities, China's economy is expected to grow by more than 5 percent in 2023, which means that China will remain a major force supporting global economic growth and the stability of the capital market.When talking about people's lives during the pandemic, some paint a bleak picture as if the Chinese people have been forced to stay indoors or quarantined for the entire past three years. But the truth is, Chinese people were able to travel around the country freely most of the time — 2.88 billion domestic trips were made in 2020, 3.25 billion in 2021 and 2.09 billion in the first three quarters of 2022. In 2020 and 2021, very few COVID-19 nucleic acid tests were administered in China. It was not until 2022 when the highly infectious Omicron variant sneaked into the country, that the Chinese government began to conduct regular testing and require negative testing results for those entering public places.These are not novel measures, as many other countries including the US also introduced compulsory measures such as curfews, quarantining, nucleic acid testing, travel restrictions, etc. when the infections were peaking.In recent years, some Western media outlets and politicians have taken to criticizing China's dynamic zero-COVID policy. However, now that China has refined some of the measures, the criticism has made way for conspiracy theories. Some are now saying that the fact that cases surged in China after the new measures were brought in indicates that there had been many unreported cases earlier and China lifted the restrictions because it was finding it difficult to implement its dynamic zero-COVID policy.However, the fact remains that prior to the ""10 new measures"" (a major COVID policy adjustment), China had already begun to refine COVID-19 control and prevention measures step by step. For instance, the ""20 new measures"" introduced in November lifted many restrictions, and the consequent rise in infection cases was within expectation. The gradual lifting of COVID-control measures is a vivid demonstration of the fact that China's policy adjustment is planned and proactive, based on facts and science.Some countries never made any effort to stop community transmission of COVID-19 and lifted all restrictive measures when the virus was still very lethal, resulting in the loss of millions of lives. In contrast, the Chinese government chose to lift the restrictions in an orderly manner, and with good reason. We are now fully aware of Omicron's high infection but low mortality rate, and protecting people's health and promoting socioeconomic development are our priorities. In fact, the government has shifted its focus from disease control to medical treatment to respond to the new realities.The fight against COVID-19 is now part of the Chinese people's collective memory, and a valuable one. No one can change it. Over the past three years, the Chinese government put people and people's lives first, and refined COVID-19 control measures in light of the evolving situation. By taking strong initiatives in the fight against the virus, people's lives and health, social and economic development, and people's freedom were protected to the maximum extent possible. China's COVID-19 policy adjustment is essentially and consequentially different from other places where beyond a point the authorities were forced to ""let it go"". It is an undeniable fact that China has achieved the best result at the least cost.The author is a Beijing-based commentator on international affairs.                           "

The UK is the second country after Australia to sign the RAA with Japan.The RAA will simplify procedures when implementing cooperative activities, such as port calls of vessels and joint exercises between the two countries and further promoting bilateral security and defense cooperation, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry.The Japanese Foreign Ministry cited the ""more severe"" international security environment in various parts of the world as well as the international order challenged by the Ukraine crisis and so-called ""attempts to unilaterally change the status quo by force in the East and South China Seas,"" claiming that the Japan-UK security and defense cooperation will be lifted to new heights and the movement toward the realization of a so-called ""free and open Indo-Pacific"" will be further enhanced.Chinese observers believe that through the pact, the possibility of Japan stationing troops in Britain is almost zero, but the possibility of the UK stationing troops in Japan is quite high.The UK, especially in the last couple of years, has been looking for chances to return to the Asia-Pacific, the Chinese observers noted.While the UK is adjusting its foreign and security strategy, there is a strong market for a tough stance against China in British politics and it is difficult for Sunak to maintain a balance. Today's Britain no longer believes that it can maintain its interests and status as a great power only by developing trade and economy, and believes instead that it should now turn to military and security aspects to boost its presence, Cui Hongjian, director of the Department of European Studies at the China Institute of International Studies, told the Global Times on Thursday.The UK has been building security and trade ties in the region. In September 2021, the UK and allies US and Australia announced the establishment of the AUKUS trilateral security pact, and now the UK and Japan have signed the defense pact, both of which have allowed the UK to bring about its Indo-Pacific tilt in military, diplomatic and political strategy. This marked the UK essentially becoming involved in the geopolitical competition in the region, observers warned.However, the UK's move goes against the region's mainstream of peace and development, Cui pointed out. As a country with a colonial history in the region, the UK's military presence goes against the historical trend and will draw disgust from the majority of people in the region, Cui told the Global Times on Thursday.The observer also questioned whether the UK had the ability or finances to support its ambitions. It is also a major test of whether the UK government can afford to play a security role in both Europe and Asia, Cui said, noting that the UK's focus should be in Europe and so-called transatlantic security amid the continuing Ukraine crisis.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Thursday that the UK and Japan could not have come together to sign this agreement without incitement and pressure from the US. The military expert pointed out that the so-called strategies of Japan and the UK have followed the global strategy of the US, as they both want to boost its influence in the Asia-Pacific to achieve so-called regional hegemony and achieve their own goals.Song said that the possibility of bringing Japan and even Canada into the AUKUS alliance in the near future could not be ruled out, as it could be an important consideration for the US in order to realize its global strategy.The observers warned China to be on the alert to the Japan-UK defense pact and a potential expansion of AUKUS, as closer military cooperation between the allies could be the first dangerous step by the US in reinventing a global military alliance, which will pose a big threat to regional peace and stability.

We hope that NATO and the EU will abandon the Cold War mentality, base their views on facts, look at China's development rationally and objectively, and do more to contribute to regional and world peace and stability, said the spokesperson. The two organizations said they are taking their partnership ""to a new level,"" according to the declaration, which reflects yet another dangerous escalation in bloc confrontation thinking in NATO and the EU, Chinese experts told the Global Times.In addition to mentioning the challenge from China, the joint statement made several references to Russia's threat to regional security and the determination of NATO and the EU to counter it. However, observers see it as more of a political message than an indication that action will be taken promptly.Tuesday's declaration is the third joint declaration between the two sides after 2016 and 2018. This declaration is more political than previous ones, French media outlet AFP quoted a European official as saying.In the declaration, NATO and the EU pledged to ""further mobilize the combined set of instruments at their disposal, be they political, economic or military,"" to pursue common objectives.At present, the Europeanization of NATO, or the NATO-ization of Europe, has become a major trend. However, the significance of the latest joint declaration is mainly to further unify their positions and does not indicate practical moves in the near future, experts told the Global Times.Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, NATO's influence in Europe has rebounded significantly, Zhang Hong, an associate research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday. With the Russia-Ukraine conflict at a stalemate, the West seems to be strengthening NATO's influence in Europe by adopting such a joint declaration that would actually immobilize this relationship between NATO and the EU, he said.Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies of East China Normal University, told the Global Times that NATO, as a military bloc left over from the Cold War, always holds a clear attitude toward Russia and China. ""However, with the recent visit of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to China and the possible visit of French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO is worried about the change in the EU's attitude, so it hopes to regulate the EU's behavior through this joint declaration,"" he said. The declaration clearly reflects the escalation of confrontational thinking in the West. In Europe and the US, conservative forces believe that China and Russia are ""already allied,"" which is the basis for the further strengthening of their bloc, the scholars believe. ""This is certainly not good news for global security, as NATO is trying to retain the 'legacy' of the Cold War and is trying to escalate the toxic trend,"" Cui said. However, the joint declaration is believed to be mainly a political message, and its practical impact in the short term is more limited, observers say. Such an escalation could further undermine Europe's security and even have a negative impact on Europe's global influence.Against the backdrop of a tense regional situation, while the declaration will in a way help boost the West's diplomatic confidence, the international influence in global politics that Europe has accumulated in the past will gradually diminish as it relinquishes its diplomatic autonomy, Zhang said.While NATO and the EU are attempting to build a pattern of bloc confrontation and want China to jump into the trap by following that line of thinking, China clearly recognizes that China and Europe have good prospects for cooperation rather than focusing on confrontation, Cui said.On Tuesday, Chinese ambassador to the EU Fu Cong met with NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana for the first time in Brussels. NATO, as an important military alliance organization, should strictly adhere to the established geographical scope, establish a rational and correct perception of China, and play a constructive role for regional and global peace and security, Fu said during the meeting. China is open to dialogue and exchange with NATO and is willing to work together to promote the healthy and stable development of relations between the two sides, he said.                          "

Facts have proved that the implementation of the law is entirely in line with the reality of Hong Kong, which has ensured Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, according to Xia.Wu Yingpeng, a lawyer and barrister-at-law in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Friday that the NSL for Hong Kong is superior in force to any local laws in HKSAR. ""HKSAR's legal system is an important part of China's legal mechanism. We should correctly understand the authoritative status of the NSL from the national constitutional level, especially the overriding role of the NSL over HKSAR's local laws.""When the local legislation is inconsistent with the NSL for Hong Kong, the court shall apply the provisions of the national security law with priority, Wu said.

This comes as Russia appointed a new commander of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and declared a military victory in Soledar in eastern Ukraine.",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2023/2023-01-18/4e34fb09-9ad7-4208-b14a-1374680db9a6.jpeg," Top leaders of the US-led NATO are holding in-person meetings from Wednesday to Thursday after military chiefs from the US and Ukraine met in Poland ahead of the meeting. This comes as Russia appointed a new commander of the ""special military operation"" in Ukraine and declared a military victory in Soledar in eastern Ukraine.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday that the goals of Moscow's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine are ""determined by Russia's core legitimate interests"" and will be fulfilled, media reported. ""There must be no military infrastructure in Ukraine that poses a direct threat to our country,"" Lavrov said, adding that Moscow also intends to make sure the rights of ethnic Russians in Ukraine were protected.Speaking at an annual news conference on Wednesday, Lavrov dismissed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's demands for a complete Russian withdrawal from Ukraine. The minister also dismissed Ukraine's insistence on payments for war damages and the prosecution of war criminals as a platform for future talks, saying ""there can be no talks with Zelensky.""Lavrov alleged ""the West makes all the decisions for Ukraine"" with the goal of using the conflict to exhaust Russia. NATO members have provided Ukraine with substantial military aid. He said Russia was ready to ""seriously consider"" any Western initiatives on ending the conflict but added, ""We haven't seen any serious proposals yet.""Lavrov said that the US was attempting to ""contain"" both Russia and China with the help of other countries, but they were alert to its ""games,"" Reuters reported. ""The West is trying to sow discord in our relations...We and China see all these games,"" he said. Ties with Beijing had never been stronger, Lavrov said.Experts said that the conflict will be more intense as Western countries focus on supplying weapons rather than mediation, while Russia is trying its best to end the conflict by 2023, whether in military or diplomatic way.NATO's highest military authority, the Military Committee, will meet in person on Wednesday and Thursday, in Brussels, Belgium. Admiral Rob Bauer, Chair of the Military Committee, will preside over the meeting, which will be attended by the Allied Chiefs of Defense and their counterparts from invitees Finland and Sweden, according to NATO's website on Wednesday. The meeting will discuss NATO members' ongoing military support to Ukraine.Ahead of the NATO meeting, the top US military officer, Army General Mark Milley, traveled to a site near the Ukraine-Poland border on Tuesday and talked to his Ukrainian counterpart face to face for the first time - a meeting underscoring the growing ties between the two militaries and coming at a critical time as Russia's war with Ukraine nears the one-year mark, the AP reported.Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met for a couple of hours with Ukraine's chief military officer, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, at an undisclosed location in southeastern Poland. The two leaders have talked frequently about Ukraine's military needs and the state of the war over the past year but had never met.The meeting comes as the international community ramps up military assistance to Ukraine, including expanded training of Ukrainian troops by the US and the provision of a Patriot missile battery, tanks and increased air defense and other weapons systems from the US and a coalition of European and other nations.On the Russian side, Chief of the General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov on January 11 was appointed commander of the integrated group of forces of the special military operation in Ukraine. Chinese military experts said this appointment means that Moscow wants to upgrade the ""special military operation"" to ""a war"" because it needs the top military commander of the country to coordinate the joint operation conducted by the Russian national armed forces, Chechnya's military forces and private military contractor the Wagner Group. Cui Heng, an assistant research fellow from the Center for Russian Studies at East China Normal University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ""since December 2022, Ukraine has faced increasing difficulties in the battlefield, as its troops are suffering from increasing losses and European countries are increasingly reluctant to keep providing expensive military assistance.""Apart from the difficult situation on the battlefield, Ukraine is also suffering from the loss of a senior official and civilian casualties caused by a helicopter crash. At least 15 people, including Ukraine's interior minister, other senior ministry officials and three children were killed on Wednesday morning when a helicopter crashed near a nursery outside Kiev, Reuters reported.At this moment, Kiev is facing a severe situation and it needs a military victory as soon as possible to reinforce its image among the West, especially when NATO is holding a meeting to discuss future military assistance, Cui noted. ""For the Russian side, under the command of Gerasimov, the Russian troops' performance has improved in recent days, and their firepower has been strengthened,"" he said.Russia wishes to end the military operation in 2023 because the presidential election in 2024 is highly important for the future of the country, so the Kremlin will strengthen inputs to the battlefield when its attempts to seek a cease-fire through diplomacy have been rebuffed by Ukraine and the West, experts said.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, said ""since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, only one NATO member is really putting efforts into mediation - Turkey. The rest of NATO's members are all focusing on military supplies. There is no chance for a cease-fire when both sides are interested in diplomacy and both want to gain a military victory first.""                         "

",https://www.globaltimes.cn/images/nopic.gif," Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, held a symposium on the morning of January 16 at the Great Hall of the People with leading officials of other political parties' central committees and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC), and representatives of personages without party affiliation, and welcomed the coming Spring Festival. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee, Xi extended warm congratulations to the newly elected leading officials of other political parties' central committees and the ACFIC, and sincere greetings and good wishes for Spring Festival to these parties, the ACFIC and personages without party affiliation, as well as to members of the united front.He stressed that 2023 is the first year to study and implement the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress after the congress, with both hopes and challenges. He hoped that all would fully study and implement the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress, perform their duties and work hard, play a greater role in bringing together the will and strength of the people and serving the overall interests of the country, and mobilize their members and the people they have close ties with to work together to promote Chinese modernization.Wang Yang, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, and Wang Huning and Ding Xuexiang, members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, attended the symposium.Zheng Jianbang, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Ding Zhongli, chairperson of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Hao Mingjin, chairperson of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Cai Dafeng, chairperson of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, He Wei, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Jiang Zuojun, chairperson of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, Wu Weihua, chairperson of the Central Committee of Jiusan Society, Su Hui, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, and Gao Yunlong, chairperson of the ACFIC, gave speeches successively and talked about the successful holding of national congresses of their parties and the ACFIC, and the successful election of their new leaderships under the care and support of the CPC Central Committee, as well as their plans for future work. Xi Nanhua, a representative of personages without party affiliation, also made a speech. They said that, with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as guide, they will thoroughly study and implement the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress, deepen political transition, comprehensively improve themselves, actively perform their duties, and strive in unity to achieve the goals and tasks set at the 20th CPC National Congress.After listening attentively to everyone's speech, Xi Jinping made an important speech. He said that in a few days, it will be the Spring Festival, which is a traditional Chinese gala. ""It gives me great pleasure to gather with you to welcome Spring Festival, to talk about friendship and to discuss state affairs.""Xi pointed out that 2022 was extremely important in the history of the Party and the country, and it also marked the 100th anniversary of the Party's release of its united front policy. All non-CPC parties have carried out education about political handover on the theme of ""unswervingly following the Party and joining hands to forge ahead into the new era."" They have kept in mind the original intention of cooperation and carried forward fine traditions, and our ideological and political consensus has been consolidated. The central committees of all these political parties and personages without party affiliation have conducted in-depth investigations and carried out democratic supervision on major issues in reform, development and stability. What they have done has provided important references for the CPC Central Committee to make decisions and policies, and effectively implement them. The ACFIC has promoted the ""Ten Thousand Enterprises Helping Ten Thousand Villages"" campaign to guide private enterprises to actively fulfill their social responsibilities and achieve high-quality development. He expressed heartfelt thanks to all on behalf of the CPC Central Committee.Xi stressed that upholding the leadership of the CPC and always working with the CPC in solidarity are the fundamental political foundation for multiparty cooperation.Xi said that the primary political responsibility of the new central leaderships of the non-CPC parties is to carry on the political legacy, deepen political consensus, and always maintain the political essence of pursuing the common goal with unity in thought and action and working together with the CPC.Xi hoped that they will make studying and implementing the guiding principles of the 20th CPC National Congress an important part of deepening the political transition, strengthen theoretical and political guidance, and guide the members of their parties and the people they have close ties with to boost their commitment to the Four Consciousnesses, the Four-sphere Confidence, and the Two Upholds, so that their thoughts and actions will conform to the major decisions and arrangements made at the 20th CPC National Congress.It is imperative to consolidate and expand the achievements made in learning and education on the history of the CPC, launch a new round of themed education activities at an appropriate time, and continue to strengthen political, ideological, theoretical and emotional identification with the leadership of the CPC and socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said.Xi pointed out that it requires concerted efforts from the whole country to accomplish the central task of building China into a strong modern socialist country in all respects and promoting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization. He hoped that the non-CPC parties will combine the strengths of multi-party cooperation with what the central task of the CPC Central Committee and overall development requires, pool their wisdom in participation in the deliberation and administration of state affairs, put forward forthright admonitions in democratic supervision, offer good advices in political consultation, and be a good advisor, a good helper and a good colleague of the CPC. They need to focus on major issues such as creating new development pattern, materializing the principle that the public sector must be unswervingly consolidated and developed, and the development of the non-public sector must be unswervingly encouraged, supported, and guided, making solid progress in promoting common prosperity, and carry out in-depth investigations and actively offer advices, Xi said. They need to diversify forms, expand channels, and constantly improve the pertinence and effectiveness of democratic supervision. They should guide their members and the people they have close ties with to strengthen their confidence, enhance their fighting spirit so that they will have the courage to overcome difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead. The ACFIC should promote the implementation of relief policies for enterprises, help private enterprises overcome specific difficulties, and boost the confidence of private sector in economic development.Xi stressed that, to give full play to the political strengths of China's new type of political party system, the non-CPC parties should further improve themselves, and take steps to make them more capable of staying on top of the overall political situation, participating in the deliberation and administration of state affairs, improving their leadership, cooperating with other parties and solving their own problems. He hoped that they inherit the fine traditions of multi-party cooperation, namely, being of one heart and mind with the CPC, loving the country and serving the people, working closely together and dedicating themselves to the common cause, so as to become parties participating in building socialism with Chinese characteristics with firm political stand, solid organization, effective performance of duties, excellent conduct and sound institutions. They should intensify their efforts to consolidate leaderships, embrace solidarity and coordination, and give full play to the overall functions of leaderships, so as to build a good image featuring pragmatism, enterprise and integrity. As this year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the ACFIC, Xi called for efforts to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the federation, adhere to reform and innovation, and advance education and guidance of the prominent members, so that the federation can better play its role as an assistant to the CPC and a bridge between business circle and the CPC.Shi Taifeng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the committee's United Front Work Department, Chen Xi, head of the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, heads of the central committees of other political parties and the ACFIC, and leading officials of relevant central authorities took part in the activity.

In a report delivered by General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Xi Jinping to the 20th National Congress of the CPC in October 2022, Xi pointed out that we will advance the Beautiful China Initiative and take a holistic and systematic approach to the conservation and improvement of mountains, waters, forests, farmlands, grasslands and deserts. ""We will carry out coordinated industrial restructuring, pollution control, ecological conservation and climate response, and promote concerted efforts to cut carbon emissions, reduce pollution, expand green development and pursue economic growth, he said. We will prioritize environmental protection, conserve resources and use them efficiently, and pursue green and low-carbon development,"" Xi said. This year's two sessions will also be the first annual gatherings for the country's two main political bodies to set priorities and plans involving the economy, military, trade, diplomacy and the environment for the next year since the country downgraded its COVID-19 management. Some experts believed that as the country's social and economic activities have been brought gradually back to normal following the adjustment and optimization of the epidemic prevention and control measures, the country's most important annual political activities are also expected to go to back to normal. Some experts considered that the economic recovery and China's population decline would be major focuses of this year's two sessions, especially when many observers and analysts remain bullish on China's economic prospects. Also, the Chinese mainland's population declined for the first time in 61 years, which attracted the world's attention. Among 2,172 members, there are 124 from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and 29 from the Macao SAR. Junius Ho Kwan-yiu, a Hong Kong Legislative Council member who is also the member of the 14th National Committee of the CPPCC from the HKSAR, told the Global Times that he will focus on proposals such as legal services exchanges between the mainland and Hong Kong, high-tech development and energy-saving and environmental protection during this year's meetings. ""This year's two sessions will mainly focus on the economic recovery, including how to accelerate the production resumption and push forward high-quality growth,"" Zhu said. In terms of the declining population, Zhu said that it's a common question that many developed countries and developing countries face after economic and social development reaches a certain level. ""How to turn China's demographic dividend into a talent dividend will also be a major focus of this year's meetings,"" he said.

With Su's resignation and Tsai's earlier resignation as head of the DPP, the secessionist party's internal divisions are expected to intensify.Su made the announcement after the region's ""legislature"" approved the general budget for fiscal 2023 and closed for winter recess on Thursday. Following the approval of the budget, he met with Tsai and again tendered his resignation after an earlier offer to resign was turned down.Su is a diehard Taiwan secessionist who was put on a sanctions list by the Chinese mainland in November 2021, according to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.After the DPP was defeated in the 2022 local ""elections"" in Taiwan, there were growing calls on the island for a reshuffle of the administrative affairs agency. Su's resignation has triggered a power struggle within the DPP and affected the party's positioning for the regional ""election"" in 2024, local media reported.Lo Ping-cheng, spokesperson for the regional ""executive body,"" said in a separate statement that Su and his team will formally step down once Tsai has confirmed their replacements.Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times on Friday that during his term of office, Su failed to adequately deal with the economic and livelihood issues of the island, as well as cross-Straits relations.While it was Tsai who resigned as the party's leader after the DPP was trounced in local ""elections"" in November 2022, many experts say it was Su's poor governance that triggered the public discontent that led to the party's defeat, Zhang said.Su's cross-Straits policy, coupled with his stubborn stance of ""Taiwan independent"" secessionism, was extremely unfriendly, Wang Yu-ching, a Taiwan cross-Straits observer who lives in the Chinese mainland, told the Global Times on Friday.After the outbreak of the pandemic, Su has deliberately used the term ""Wuhan pneumonia"" when describing COVID-19, and banned the export of masks from Taiwan island to the Chinese mainland. Besides this, he had set various restrictions preventing mainland students from returning to school in Taiwan and mainland family members from reuniting in Taiwan. He once said that in case of war, he would fight the People's Liberation Army to the end even if it was only with a broom in hand.""Deteriorating cross-Straits relations led to the unemployment of many Taiwan people. They could no longer stand Su's incompetence and arrogance,"" Wang added. A recent poll on the island, released on Friday after Su's resignation, shows that 85.2 percent of the public believe that Su should resign, and 84.1 percent were dissatisfied with his work.Meanwhile, analysts noted that the power void after Su's resignation will lead to more bitter infighting among the different DPP factions.The ousting of Su's faction means an opportunity for DPP members from other factions to make political gains, Wang said.Echoing Wang, Zhang said that he believes that regarding Lai Ching-te, the vice leader of the Taiwan region since 2022 and the incumbent DPP chairman, Tsai's camp will seek to balance him by appointing a new head of the executive body.In contrast to Su's hard-nosed stance, Chen Chien-jen, Tsai's confidant and the former vice leader of the Taiwan region who's in a pole position for succeeding Su, has always taken a more low-key and pragmatic stance on cross-Strait relations.""This may also be an adjustment by Tsai's camp to cater to changing public opinion on the island: peace rather than war. And Taiwan secession means war,"" Zhang said.""However, Lai, the DPP's most popular candidate in 2024 Taiwan's regional leader 'election,' represents an extreme pro-secession stance.

Being a democratically elected representative, even if I cannot represent all of Hong Kong residents, I can at least represent a good amount of them,"" Lee said. ""Then why are they refusing to listen to our side of the story?"" he asked, noting that it is hypocritical for some UK politicians to claim that they are a democratic country but refuse to listen to voices from different jurisdictions.""The fact that I cannot attend this seminar is not my loss, nor is it Hong Kong's loss,"" Lee said. The Hong Kong lawmaker pointed out that the UK will suffer the biggest loss by withdrawing the invitation as it will lose an opportunity to further understand Hong Kong's legislature while such political manipulation won't damage the spirit of local lawmakers.                          "

Bateman said ""it is well past time for Speaker McCarthy and the ultra MAGA Republican House members to come out of the dark and tell the American people, in-full, what they decided in secret.""While McCarthy insisted he made no formal agreements in exchange for getting conservative holdouts to vote for him, conservative members have said they received certain promises from the new speaker, Politico reported.For 100 years, the election of the speaker was decided after a single round of voting, but this time, it took 15 to produce a result, Lü Xiang, an expert on US studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday, noting that this can be seen as a prelude to a fundamental split in the Republican Party in the long run. ""It shows that the two-party system can no longer function properly in the American political environment,"" Lü said.Li Haidong, a professor at the Institute of International Relations at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times that McCarthy's election came as a result of compromise within the Republican Party, but the battle between the two opposing parties in the US remains bitter, now and for some time to come, and will be difficult to reconcile.The main reason is that the Republican Party refuses to compromise on the current distribution of power in the US, Li noted. Such opposition has worsened the existing political environment in the US, greatly reduced the quality of American politics, and made social problems more serious and difficult to alleviate.According to NBC News, McCarthy offered to lower the threshold to force a vote on ousting the House Speaker down to just one member. In addition, McCarthy also promised to put more right-wing hard-liners on key House committees and vote on a series of conservative bills.""The few agreements we know about would fundamentally reshape our economy in a devastating way for working families and criminalize women for making their own healthcare decisions,"" Bates said. In the future, US politics may lean toward a more European style with multiple parties contesting elections, Lü said. It is hard to sustain a functioning two-party system just by lumping people with totally different political views together.McCarthy is expected make moves on a number of China-related issues, as he wants to cast more shadows and disrupt the Biden administration, experts pointed out. McCarthy represents a more extreme group of lawmakers with no political experience and no boundaries, Lü said. Therefore, people will see the whole domestic atmosphere in the US will be clouded by China-related issues.It is predictable that McCarthy's position will be precarious, and it will be difficult for him to do his job. It is more likely that McCarthy will do something drastic to secure his position, such as compromising on domestic issues or shifting attention to China, Yuan Zheng, deputy director and a senior fellow of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Wednesday.

He explained that the US hopes that increasing accessible bases in Philippines can block the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) within the first island chain or at least thwart PLA operations. The US wants to increase operational flexibility in the scenario of a war by expanding access to foreign bases, but the host country should be cautious of being used as a ""shield"" for Washington's belligerence, Zhang said. Xu Liping, director of the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, saw the move as more symbolic than of practical significance, because US operations in those Philippine bases would be very limited. An EDCA allows US access to Philippine bases for joint training, pre-positioning of equipment and building of facilities such as runways, fuel storage and military housing, but not a permanent presence. Analysts also noted strong opposition among local civilian populations against increased US deployments. According to media reports, the US will help the Philippines modernize its military and has included the Philippines as a pilot country in a maritime domain awareness initiative. The two countries also recently agreed to conduct more than 500 activities together throughout the year. The Philippines looks forward to enhancing defense capabilities, Xu said, but the country also has a clear mind on how to manage relationship with China and US, and its priority lies in economic development, infrastructure and living standards, where China is playing a key role among all its regional partners. The EDCA was revived after Marcos took office, but the president has also expressed great hope, confidence and determination to further develop bilateral relations to a higher level in a friendly atmosphere during his state visit to China in January. During the visit, China and the Philippines signed a slate of cooperation agreements and announced the resumption of negotiation on joint oil and gas cooperation.  Should the US-Philippine agreement be finalized, Xu predicted the US will herald it as major progress in its Indo-Pacific Strategy targeting China, while the Philippines would be very careful in its use of rhetoric, being reluctant to impact China-Philippine relations. It is difficult for the Philippines to satisfy all parties against the backdrop of escalating China-US confrontation, but Chinese analysts reminded the future of the Philippines lies in the Asia-Pacific region, not as Washington's cannon fodder. The Philippines emphasizes that its military cooperation with the US ""does not target any specific third party."" But if the US has no ""third party"" on mind, it would not be so interested in the Philippines, analysts said. Frequent visits to Philippines by senior US officials in recent months demonstrated that Washington is keen on recruiting Manila as a pivot in Southeast Asia to implement its Indo-Pacific Strategy, and the fine line of balance would be increasingly difficult to maintain.

This shows hypocrisy and ill-intentioned efforts to use Hong Kong to contain the Chinese mainland. The latest remarks were made after the UK Home Office said in an official video on Tuesday that ""the UK is proud to have welcomed 144,500 people from Hong Kong since our BN(O) visa launch two years ago."" The Chinese Embassy in the UK also strongly condemned the latest remarks from the British side, saying that the remarks seriously interfere in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs, trampling on the basic norms of international relations, according to a statement released on Wednesday. The British side insisted on implementing the so-called BN(O) visa scheme under the pretext of the NSL for Hong Kong, seriously violating the Sino-British Joint Declaration and relevant agreements between the two sides, the embassy said.China has officially withdrawn its recognition of BN(O) visas as a valid travel and ID document starting from January 31, 2021, as the UK began accepting applications from BN(O)-eligible Hong Kong residents starting on the same day.All the facts have proved that by playing the BN(O) card, the UK is trying to use more Hong Kong people for its political purposes, which shifts the focus from domestic problems, the spokesperson said on Wednesday. Some media reports said that after some Hong Kong residents moved to the UK, they have had a difficult life. There have even been some reports of suicide.The so-called right to ""enjoy life"" is just false rhetoric by the British side, and its hypocrisy is widely known, the spokesperson said. ""The BN(O) scheme is doomed to be another unsustainable performance of hypocrisy."" The tragic death of a 27-year-old Hong Kong master's graduate, which was suicide according to a coroner's ruling, shows the difficulties of moving to live in the UK, Hong Kong media outlet The Standard reported on Friday. Fion Ho Yee-king's death came after seven months of hardship, and this is just the tip of the iceberg, a migrant in London was quoted as saying in the report. The applicants leave Hong Kong for various reasons, such as career advancement, family reunion and settlement, further studies and retirement. Of course, some are also those who participated in and supported the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, Chu Ka Krin, a veteran current affairs commentator based in Hong Kong, told the Global Times on Wednesday. ""The applicants may still maintain close ties and proximity with Hong Kong, and it does not mean those who leave Hong Kong are abandoning it or that they will never return to their homeland. Application for a BN(O) permit does not mean a loss of confidence in Hong Kong,"" Chu said. Staying in the UK and having affection for Hong Kong are not mutually exclusive, he said. The BN(O) is just a tentative grant to stay in UK and it does not mean right of abode or citizenship. The spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office urged the UK side to clearly view the general trend and stop using the BN(O) matter to cover up for anti-China rioters and stop interfering in China's internal affairs. With new ministers and cabinet members appointed in the UK, policies in areas including immigration keep changing and more updates are expected. These affect the immigrants and BN(O) applicants, making their future uncertain, Chu said.                          "

The 2024 election to become regional leader is already starting to heat up between different factions within the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).A total of 29 DPP officials retained in the reshuffle, with only nine newly appointed, and six out of the above nine had previously served in Su's ""cabinet.""Regarding the reshuffle, experts said that the most obvious feature is the ""factional co-governance and balance"" within the DPP. Moreover, internal strife will continue in the DPP, but an unscrupulous power struggle will only harm Taiwan people, as they care more about their livelihoods.There are three major factions in the DPP: the ""New Tide"" faction, the largest faction within the party led by DPP's party chief Lai Ching-te; Tsai's faction which includes Chen and Mayor of Kaohsiung Chen Chi-mai; and ""Taiwan Normal Country Promotion Association"" faction, led by the island's legislative body leader You Si-kun.There are also smaller factions, such as the Su faction, led by Su Tseng-chang, and ""Taiwan Forward"" faction, led by pro-secession media tycoon Lin Kun-hai.Taiwan-based media described the latest reshuffle in top executive body as ""all factions get their candies."" Chen from Tsai's camp was appointed as executive head, his deputy is Cheng Wen-tsan from the ""New Tide,"" while Lin Yu-chang from ""Taiwan Forward"" was appointed as interior affairs chief. Politicians from smaller DPP factions also found their seats.Analysts said that the DPP has been ""governed by factions,"" with various groups forming alliances to ""share the cake."" When the Tsai faction was still weak before the 2016 regional election, it chose to form an alliance with the ""Taiwan Forward,"" the second largest faction in the party at that time.Chiu Yi, a former ""lawmaker"" in Taiwan and a Taiwan-based pro-reunification scholar, told the Global Times on Wednesday that there are still two small groups within the ""New Tide,"" the southern one was led by Lai while the northern one was represented by Cheng, who is closer to Tsai.And Tsai also coopted Cheng to counterbalance Lai, trying to divide the ""New Tide,"" he added.Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province, said that factional struggle is DPP's tradition, which is crucial to the distribution of power and benefits. Therefore, although the DPP agreed to dissolve factions in 2006, it did not fundamentally change the reality of the development of factions.In Taiwan's regional ""legislative body"" in 2020, only six of the 61 DPP ""lawmakers"" have no factional background. The ""New Tide"" is the biggest winner with 18 ""lawmakers,"" followed by 14 from Tsai's camp and nine from ""Taiwan Normal Country Promotion Association.""The fight within the DPP for a bigger slice of the pie is even fiercer than facing other parties.Wang recalled to the Global Times how Su and Frank Hsieh fought for the nomination to represent DPP in regional leadership race. He said that in addition to political attacks, the two men exchanged insults fiercely to a degree that were ""never seen before,"" even worse than smearing their enemies.In the 2019 DPP primary election for regional leadership nomination, the Tsai's camp smeared Lai of the ""New Tide,"" and manipulated follow-up public opinion polls.Lai retaliated by purging Tsai's advisers Hung Yao-fu, the former secretary-general of DPP, as soon as Lai became DPP's new party chief.""This is the beginning of Lai's revenge,"" Chiu said, noting that Tsai has the ""administrative machinery"" and control of the intelligence unit, which allows her faction to collect disgraceful evidence of political opponents for the media and use tax investigations to deter paymasters from backing Lai financially in election campaign, which is also a common tactic.An unscrupulous power struggle will only make the people of the island disillusioned with the DPP and abandon it, as it only goes for political gains rather than people's livelihoods, Wang said.According to a report from Taiwan-based media udn.com that ""factional co-governance"" has always been a politer term, and its essence is not much different from ""sharing spoils."" Regarding to the new list of ""cabinet members,"" it is nothing more than appeasing different factions through resource allocation, with the subtext that ""no one is allowed to be rebellious.""Since the defeat in the local election in November 2022, DPP has been in a state of crisis, with factions competing for resources and the slightest mistake will break the factional balance. Tsai's apparent balanced layout may trigger even worse imbalance, thus affecting DPP's election in 2024.Some analysts, however, said the DPP has a history of factional conflict in surface, but preferring to seek to maintain its advantage as a whole over other parties through ""temporary solidarity"" after the conflict.Lai Yueh-chien, a Taiwan-based political scholar, told the Global Times that although the ""New Tide"" is the largest faction in DPP, it will not be like a ""winner-takes-all"" way. ""They always take a big chunk, and they share the spoils,"" he said.Power struggle within the DPP is fierce, but people always find a way out, he said. And that's why the opposition party like Kuomintang cannot afford to take the 2024 election lightly.                         "

Suryodipuro, director of ASEAN cooperation at Indonesia's foreign ministry, said on the sidelines of the event.China and ASEAN approved the framework for the COC for the South China Sea in 2017 out of the need to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties (DOC) in the South China Sea. The two sides later arrived at the single draft negotiating text later in 2018. The code is expected to act as a preventive diplomatic measure and crisis management mechanism for South China Sea-related issues. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, negotiations have stalled for years. The new rounds of negotiations have drawn attention as experts take them as a continuation of a stable and positive trend that indicates an overall peaceful and stable situation in the South China Sea. However, some others worry they may be affected by some recent setbacks between China and ASEAN member states. Last week, the US managed to expand access to four additional military bases in the Philippines to boost its military flexibility in possible war scenarios with China. In early January, Indonesia deployed a warship to its North Natuna Sea to monitor a Chinese coast guard vessel, claiming that it had been in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone for some time.The situation in the South China Sea is mainly affected by two main factors - US interference and some related countries' priority of their own interests over regional consensus, Wang Xiaopeng, an expert in maritime and border studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Sunday.  The regional situation and negotiations concerning the COC remain stable, but the US is trying to drive a wedge between China and regional countries. For example, the Philippines in the latest case, so China should be prepared, Wang warned.Inked in 2002, the DOC is widely viewed as the first major political document on the South China Sea issue between China and the ASEAN members. In accordance with the spirit of the DOC, disputes in the South China Sea should be resolved through friendly consultation and negotiation between the countries concerned with the South China Sea, while peace and stability in the region should be jointly maintained by China and ASEAN members. Article 10 of the DOC reads that ""the Parties concerned reaffirm that the adoption of a code of conduct in the South China Sea would further promote peace and stability in the region and agree to work, on the basis of consensus, towards the eventual attainment of this objective."" This means ""adoption"" of a code of conduct is the ultimate goal. If negotiations on the code are left unfinished, the DOC cannot be carried out and mutual trust between China and ASEAN members will be negatively impacted, which in turn means the South China Sea will once again become an arena of major power games, analysts explained. When explaining why the DOC and the COC are inseparable, , director general of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, stressed during an interview with the Global Times at a symposium in July 2022 commemorating the 20th anniversary of the signing of the DOC that the DOC is the foundation of the COC, without which the latter would not be possible. The formulation of the COC is clearly stipulated in the DOC. Therefore, the important principles and spirit contained in the DOC should be fully reflected in the formulation of the COC, Hong said. Facing interference from countries outside the region, Hong stressed that if China and ASEAN members can stay focused and do things that are conducive to peace and stability in the South China Sea, any external interference will not be successful.                          "

Furthermore, the resumption and expansion of cross-Straits exchanges seems to be the inevitable trend in the post-COVID-19 era, even in the face of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities' obstruction.Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said at a press briefing on Monday that the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges with the KMT, consolidate and enhance mutual trust, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in various fields on the common political foundation of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing Taiwan secession.Joint efforts should be made to advance relations between the Communist Party of China and the KMT and relations across the Taiwan Straits, safeguard peace and stability across the Straits, and improve the interests and well-being of compatriots on both sides of the Straits, Zhu noted.The KMT delegation will hold talks with Song Tao, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing, the KMT said in a statement on Monday. As long as the Taiwan authorities can recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, cross-Straits consultations and negotiations will resume, Song said at a seminar held Sunday, according to the Xinhua News Agency.The KMT also claimed the visit would be an ""apolitical"" one, focusing on agricultural and fishery products, people's livelihood and other economic issues. The delegation is also expected to meet with Taiwan businesspeople during trips to other mainland cities. Zhang Wensheng, deputy dean of the Taiwan Research Institute at Xiamen University, told the Global Times that the DPP's restrictions on cross-Straits exchanges and ""anti-mainland"" practices on the island caused strong discontent among the public. By visiting the mainland, the KMT hopes to send a message to Taiwan society that the DPP can't ease cross-Straits tensions, while the KMT can.The DPP authorities refuse to accept the one-China principle, so they have no way of communicating with the mainland, which actually gives the KMT an opportunity to make voters think about what to choose: choosing to keep cross-Strait relations tense and even dangerous, or choosing peace and stability, Zhang said. Chao Chun-shan, a member of Hsia's delegation and a former top consultant of Taiwan regional leader Ma Ying-jeou, said on Monday that the KMT will ""do the right things for cross-Straits relations,"" Taiwan media reported. He said that the delegation wants to convey a message that Taiwan people are not all provocative secessionists like the DPP, as they want peace, not war. He also called on the DPP to hold dialogue with the mainland to reduce misunderstandings, as zero contact results in zero benefits for Taiwan.""The KMT generally recognizes the 1992 consensus, is opposed to Taiwan secession, and will play a role in easing tensions,"" said Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province.""The mainland may give it a positive response,"" Wang told the Global Times on Monday. Cross-Straits exchanges are recovering in the post-epidemic era, and it is likely that there will be an expansion of cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges, trade and tourism, Wang said.                           "

They slandered the situation of human rights and the rule of law in Hong Kong, and interfered in its judicial proceedings. The Chinese side urged the US politicians to stop their twisted political show immediately, as they flagrantly denigrated the human rights and rule of law in Hong Kong and interfering in its normal judicial system, a spokesperson of the office said in a statement.A National Security Law trial of 47 opposition figures began on Monday in Hong Kong, drawing widespread attention both locally and overseas. The ultimate intention of these suspects was to take power in HKSAR by using loopholes in the city's electoral system and to seek independence by colluding with external forces, according to media reports. Prosecutors on Monday began explaining their basis for accusing the 47 suspects of conspiracy to commit subversion, in the high-profile case. Representatives from the UK, the US, Sweden, Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, European Union and France were also among those queuing up outside the court on Monday, according to the Guardian.Laurence Vandewalle from the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macau, said the EU had been observing trials across the world ""as a sign of commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law"", the report noted.The Commissioner's Office spokesperson pointed out that before the nomination of candidates for the Seventh Legislative Council of the HKSAR (LegCo) in 2020, those anti-China elements in Hong Kong had conspired to organize a ""primary election"" and fabricate public opinions in an attempt to seize control of the LegCo.In so doing, they sought to paralyze the SAR Government and pressure both the Central and the SAR governments, said the spokesperson, adding that such a despicable plot not only jeopardized the democratic electoral system stipulated in the Basic Law of the HKSAR, but is also suspected of committing the crime of subversion under the National Security Law for the HKSAR.Enforcing laws and holding lawbreakers accountable is the core tenet of the rule of law. No one has the privilege to be above the law, and no rights and freedoms should cross the bottom line of national security. This is not only an explicit provision of relevant international conventions, but also a legal practice among all countries.However, some politicians from a few countries insist on hypocrisy and double standards, repeatedly interfere in the judiciary of the HKSAR, and put political manipulation above the law. Without caring about democratic chaos in their own countries, they vilified the National Security Law for the HKSAR, sugarcoated anti-China forces in Hong Kong as ""fighters for freedom,"" and meddled with the judiciary of the SAR, the spokesperson noted.The spokesperson stressed that the rule of law is a cornerstone of Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and ""one country, two systems"" has always been upheld based on the rule of law. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, public order in Hong Kong has been restored, the legal principles upheld, development back on track and the rights and freedoms of local residents better protected.The spokesperson said that in the face of the historical trend of Hong Kong moving from chaos to stability and prosperity, Western politicians can never get their way in disrupting the city by interfering in the judiciary of the SAR. No external forces can dampen the legal foundation in Hong Kong or the confidence of the international community in Hong Kong's rule of law, nor can they impact our strong determination to safeguard ""one country, two systems"" and national security.""We urge Western politicians to put themselves in the right position, recognize the reality, earnestly respect the spirit of the rule of law, and immediately stop interfering in and damaging the judicial system of Hong Kong,"" the spokesperson said.Global Times                          "

They are all members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has been a shared aspiration of the Chinese people since the beginning of modern times, Xi noted, adding that the historical task of exploring the Chinese path to modernization fell on the shoulders of the CPC.Xi stressed that since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the Party has made new progress based on previous explorations, continuously achieved innovations and breakthroughs in theory and practice, and successfully advanced and expanded Chinese modernization.The historic achievements and changes, particularly the elimination of absolute poverty and the completion of the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, have resulted in more robust institutions, stronger material foundations, and a source of inspiration for taking greater initiative for Chinese modernization, Xi added.Noting that Party leadership is vital to the fundamental direction, future and success of Chinese modernization, and defines the fundamental nature of Chinese modernization, Xi said only by upholding Party leadership can Chinese modernization have a promising future.Xi stressed that the modernization process of a country needs to follow the general rule of modernization, but it shall be suited to its realities and characterized by features unique to its context.Citing the report to the 20th CPC National Congress, Xi said Chinese modernization is characterized by five features that are unique to the Chinese context. It is the modernization of a huge population, of common prosperity for all, of material and cultural-ethical advancement, of harmony between humanity and nature, and of peaceful development.Xi said Chinese modernization is a new model for human advancement, and it dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity.Advancing Chinese modernization is a systematic endeavor, Xi stressed, adding that it is also an exploratory undertaking.Once the strategy is formulated, it must be adhered to over the long term, he said, adding that the right direction of Chinese modernization must be ensured.Xi said innovation must be placed in a prominent position in overall national development, and efforts must be made to achieve higher efficiency than capitalism while maintaining fairness in the society more effectively.He also demanded more efforts to expand high-standard opening up and deeply involve the country in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation.""The cause of promoting Chinese modernization, which is an unprecedented and pioneering venture, will inevitably encounter all kinds of risks, challenges, difficulties and even dangerous storms, some of which we can foresee and others we cannot,"" Xi said. ""Let us harness our indomitable fighting spirit to open new horizons for our cause.""Xi stressed the importance of the work during this year in advancing Chinese modernization. The decisions and plans made by the CPC Central Committee must be fully implemented and efforts must be made to achieve an overall improvement in the economy, he said.Presiding over the opening of the session, Li Qiang said that the important speech delivered by Xi enriched and developed the theory of Chinese modernization and should be carefully studied and grasped.

Chinese military analysts warn that the plan poses a serious threat to regional countries including China, North Korea and Russia. China is right and capable of making a ""strategic response"" to counter the potential provocative act, they noted.   The US has suggested deploying medium-range missiles in Japan as part of a plan to bolster ""defenses against China"" along the East and South China Seas, the Japanese media Sankei newspaper reported on Saturday, citing unidentified persons involved in US-Japan relations.Song Zhongping, a Chinese military expert and TV commentator, told the Global Times on Monday that if the plan is eventually realized, that means the US intends to further damage regional peace and security, and it is actually planning military interventions to disrupt China's reunification process in the future. ""New deployment of US missiles in Japan will not only pose a threat to China, but also to North Korea and Russia in the region. China is right to take strategic action to respond if such a provocative and dangerous act is made by the US,"" Song noted. The Tomahawk is a type of subsonic cruise missile, and different variants have different ranges, generally of around 2,000 kilometers, meaning that if deployed in Kyushu, the missile can cover not only the island of Taiwan and the East China Sea, but also the eastern coast of the Chinese mainland, a Beijing-based military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Monday.While not yet in service, a number of hypersonic missile projects are underway in the US. They are characterized by their speeds of higher than Mach 5, and can pair up with the slower Tomahawks for various tactical purposes, including attacking targets in the Chinese mainland and amphibious landing forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), the expert said.While Washington intends to deploy new weapons for US forces in Japan, Tokyo is also planning to purchase Tomahawk missiles from the US and is developing its own hypersonic missiles, according to media reports.It reflects the US and Japan's obvious scheme to militarily contain China, and their intention to interfere in the Taiwan question by force, analysts said.However, Japan must understand that the US is using it as a forward operating base, in other words, Japan is being used as a cannon fodder, the expert said. ""If US forces in Japan and the Japan Self-Defense Force interfere in the Taiwan question, military installations from which attacks are launched on Japanese soil are bound to see resolute counterattacks from China,"" he said.Song said if those weapons are deployed on those Japanese islands close to Taiwan, they will be easily targeted and destroyed because they have no way to run on those small islands, and missiles carried by the US and Japanese vessels will pose more of a threat during wartime. Japan is completely within attacking range of the PLA, as the PLA Navy and Air Force regularly holds patrols near Japan, and the PLA Rocket Force operates more advanced missiles, including the DF-17 hypersonic missile, the DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile, the DF-10A subsonic cruise missile and the DF-100 supersonic cruise missile, observers said.

The claim that China has built more ICBM launchers than the US is speculation based on exaggeration and the ""China threat theory,"" said analysts.  More importantly, the US has more nuclear warheads than China does, and it is unreasonable and unfair for the US to use China's nuclear buildup to justify its own hegemonic nuclear ambition that could break the nuclear balance between major powers and threated world peace, experts said. The US military has notified the Congress that China now has more land-based intercontinental-range missile launchers than the US, ""fueling the debate about how the US should respond to China's nuclear buildup,"" said a report by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday.""The number of land-based fixed and mobile ICBM launchers in China exceeds the number of ICBM launchers in the United States,"" General Anthony Cotton,  commander of the US Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear forces, wrote in a letter to the Armed Services Committees of the Senate and the House on January 26. A joint statement released on Tuesday by Republican leaders of Congress' Armed Services committees called the letter ""a wake-up call for the United States,"" CNN reported on Tuesday.CNN reported that ""ICBMs are a staple in the US nuclear triad, which includes nuclear delivery systems on land and in the air and sea.""

US military officers were just hyping the 'China threat theory' again.""Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times on Wednesday that ""the US military and politicians are using trickery to fool the US public. The US' strategic nuclear capabilities mainly consist of sea-based and air-based launch platforms, so when they compare land-based launchers in the US and China, they are just finding excuses to support their China threat theory for their own greedy purposes.""The purpose of the US military is simple - to justify its budgetary demands to expand the US' nuclear arsenal and build more weapons for nuclear war, Song said. ""They want to use Columbia-class nuclear submarines to replace the Ohio-class submarine, and also want more new B21 strategic bombers to replace the old B2, B1, B1B and B52 bombers. They are also developing the LGM-35 Sentinel ICBM system,"" Song said. Even if China has built more ICBM launchers than in the past, it is legitimate and reasonable, because the increasing strategic pressures and threats imposed by the US and its allies around China have forced China to spend more resources to strengthen its nuclear deterrent and second strike capability, said a Beijing-based military expert who asked for anonymity.""China needs a powerful and convincing nuclear deterrent to make sure those hegemonic forces and their followers dare not offend and harm China's national security, sovereignty, and the right of development,"" he told the Global Times on Wednesday.

The country is also urged to stop making unwarranted accusations against China and undermining China-US counter-narcotics cooperation, nor should it mislead the public and shift its responsibility for its ineffective response to drug abuse at home onto others, read the report.The US National Center for Drug Abuse Statistics (NCDAS) lists eight categories of drugs most commonly used in the country: alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, fentanyl, opioids (mainly referring to controlled psychotropic substances), prescription stimulants, methamphetamine, and heroin. According to the report, 46 percent of US drug users report having experienced using cannabis and prescription stimulants, 36 percent with opioids and methamphetamine, 31 percent with prescription stimulants, 15 percent with heroin and 10 percent with cocaine.In 2021, findings by NCDAS showed that about 19.4 percent of Americans have used illegal substances at least once. Out of the 280 million people aged 12 and older, 31.9 million are drug users, with 11.7 percent on illegal substances and 19.4 percent either having consumed illicit drugs or misused prescription drugs in 2020. If alcohol and tobacco users are included, the number of people in the US who abuse substances totals 165 million, said the report.During the past 12 months, 48.2 million Americans over the age of 18 consumed cannabis at least once. Though outlawed by the federal authorities, cannabis is legal in 15 states for recreational use. Legal cannabis sales in the US hit a record $17.5 billion in 2020, a 46 percent jump from that of 2019, according to BDSA, a platform providing cannabis sales data.During the past 12 months, 10.1 million Americans have consumed opium at least once. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid is the primary driver of the spike in drug-related deaths. Between April 2020 and April 2021, 75,000 Americans died from opium overuse, representing more than 75 percent of the total deaths from drug overdose and a 50 percent rise year on year.Each year, 95,000 people in the country die from alcohol abuse. During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 60 percent of Americans increased their consumption of alcohol. Also, adolescents are experiencing the fastest rise in drug overdose deaths. In this group, 18 to 25-year-olds are the heaviest drug users, with 39 percent of them using drugs. Seventy percent of drug users try illicit drugs before the age of 13, and drug users as a population group are becoming younger. The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) reports that between January and June 2021, about 1,150 youngsters aged 14 to 18 died from drug overdose, a 20 percent increase from that of 2020 and more than double the number in 2019.Drug abuse has led to enormous social cost in the country.Drug overdose exacts a high death toll on the US population, greatly eroding the labor force base and weighing on life expectancy. According to a report in the American journal Science, the American death toll from drug overdose has increased exponentially over the past 38 years - up 9 percent almost every year and doubling about every eight years. A record 72,000 deaths were registered in 2017. The damage to cranial nerves caused by drug taking may aggravate anxiety and cognitive disorder, induce some mental illnesses, and cause emotion dysregulation, thus leading to problems like family discord, violent crimes, and psychological trauma in children. Also, drug control measures incur tremendous social costs. Since 1971, the US has spent 1 trillion dollars combating drug-related crimes, according to a study by the University of Pennsylvania. In 2017, the cost of drug control in the US exceeded $270 billion.The report pointed out that the US government has pushed for the legalization of cannabis and other drugs out of economic considerations. Legalizing cannabis allows the government to generate significant tax revenues from the legal drug market, and in turn, the distribution of such revenues becomes an important driver of drug legalization. The drug problem is a manifestation of the US' failure in social governance. According to Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the US Department of Health and Human Services, drug and substance abuse in the country is one of its most devastating public health disasters. In addition to putting a heavy burden on the public health system, it could lead to millions of people losing their homes or jobs, truancy or family breakdown. The COVID-19 pandemic masked this crisis, but at the same time also amplified it. The crisis shows the US government's failed regulation across multiple systems, and it is imperative to make a prompt, unified and comprehensive response, he said.Global Times                         "

Prior to the pandemic, direct cross-strait flights covered 51 destinations in the mainland and 10 destinations in Taiwan.We hope that the Taiwan authorities can follow public opinion, take practical measures and stop using the epidemic as an excuse to block the resumption of normal direct flights across the Taiwan Straits, Zhu said.  between Taiwan's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland's Fujian Province have continued this week, but the services are restricted to residents of the two islands, mainland spouses of Taiwan residents, and students studying in the two islands, media reported. ""The epidemic on the mainland has been well put under control, and compatriots on both sides of the Straits have a strong desire for normal exchanges to resume,"" Zhu said. ""Using the epidemic as an excuse to block cross-Straits exchanges runs counter to public opinion and is unpopular.""Zhu said that the mainland remains committed to the promotion of economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Straits and will continue to facilitate the import of Taiwan food products.Zhu's remarks came at a time when members of Taiwan region's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party are embarking on  from Wednesday to February 17 to consolidate exchanges and cooperation. Zhu said on Monday that the mainland is willing to strengthen exchanges with the KMT and deepen exchanges and cooperation on the common political foundation of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing Taiwan secession.Wang Yingjin, director of the Center for Cross-Straits Relations Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the mainland is making great efforts for peaceful reunification, whether calling on the DPP not to put obstacles in the way of cross-Straits exchanges or discussing cross-Straits exchanges and cooperation with the KMT.Cross-Straits people-to-people exchanges, dialogue and integrated development may be the focus of mainland efforts in 2023, but the first thing is to break the deadlock that the DPP authorities have created over the past three years with the epidemic as its shield. According to Wang, both Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP are diving head first into an awkward dilemma. On one hand, their pro-secession stance requires them to reject normal cross-Straits exchanges. But they also fear a further loss of votes in the 2024 local elections in the face of public opinion on the island calling for peace and resumption of normal cross-Straits interaction.As long as the DPP authorities recognize the 1992 Consensus, which embodies the one-China principle, and takes concrete actions to stop provocation seeking ""independence"" and collaborating with external forces against the mainland, cross-Straits dialogue and consultations can be resumed, Zhu said.

However, the post was labeled as ""false information,"" and said that an independent verification agency had reviewed it. Instagram even provided a link to a news article as evidence that the post released by the Chinese foreign ministry was ""fake."" This so-called evidence is another ridiculous own goal made by Instagram. The link, from a local Telugu language website, said that in November 2022, a number of accounts from India claimed to have shared a video link showing the river lamp in India's Hyderabad, which was actually the video of Guangxi's dragon lantern cruises posted by China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office. According to this Indian website, the video posted by some Indian netizens was actually published by the Chinese media outlet China Daily in September 2022, and the scenes in the video actually took place in China's Guangxi, not India. To put it simply, Instagram took the link to help China clarify the facts as evidence that ""Chinese authorities published false information"" and discredited and smeared China in the name of dealing with rumors. The label ""false information'' is still attached to the post of the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Instagram as of press time, and Instagram has so far failed to offer any explanation or apology even after an inquiry was sent to the platform on Sunday by the Global Times.

He noted that the disaster will present a test to the Erdogan administration's  governance capability.Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken repeatedly since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and Turkey has acted as mediator alongside the United Nations to set up a deal allowing grain exports from Ukrainian ports. Also, the aftermath of the earthquake could also affect energy security in Europe, Wang said. Since the Ukraine crisis began, discussions have been held on the construction of gas pipelines passing through Turkey reaching Europe. However, such strong earthquakes could force people to rethink the possibility of the instability of seismic zones in Turkey and may affect the directions of future energy channels in the long run, Wang noted.                          "

According to the plan, Beijing will establish a new disease prevention and control system in accordance to the national reform plan of disease prevention and control system and the Beijing authorities' arrangement.

The talks, like previous ones, are not expected to yield substantial results, as they are a political show for both sides, Chinese mainland experts said.The talks, which started on Saturday, will discuss a total of 11 major issues, with the separatist DPP authorities hoping to prioritize four issues: trade facilitation, small- and medium-sized enterprises, anti-corruption and good regulatory practices. But observers say the US will not really promote matters that will benefit the island's livelihood, but is only aimed at using the island as a pawn to counter the Chinese mainland.The Chinese mainland on Wednesday again expressed its firm opposition to the US negotiating any agreement with Taiwan island that has sovereignty implications or is official in nature. We urge the US to take practical actions to abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiqués. Attempts to play the ""Taiwan card"" to hinder China's reunification and national rejuvenation will not succeed, said Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council on Wednesday. The DPP authorities are also warned that there will be a price to pay for the action of colluding with external forces and selling out the interests of islanders for political gains. The initiative was launched in June 2022, shortly after the US announced the so-called Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which left out Taiwan island despite the DPP's eagerness to join. A couple of rounds of talks have been held, including meetings in November 2022. Experts noted that like the previous stalemate, it seems that it will be hard for negotiations on the trade initiative to make substantial progress in this round, the underlying reason being that the US does not really expect and promote economic and trade cooperation with the Taiwan authorities, but only uses it as a pawn to counter the Chinese mainland.""There is a huge gap between the US' goals and the expectations of the Taiwan authorities,"" said Wang Jianmin, a senior cross-Straits expert at Minnan Normal University in Fujian Province, noting that since the US does not want to completely anger the Chinese mainland, it will not meet DPP authorities' demands.Echoing Wang, Tang Yonghong, deputy director of the Taiwan Research Center at Xiamen University, also pointed out that DPP's demands are unlikely to be met, citing the island's unsuccessful appeal to join the IPEF.""The current negotiations are also a way for the US to appease the DPP authorities after the unsuccessful appeal,"" Tang said. Even if a so-called economic and trade agreement can be reached, it will not be of any substantial help to Taiwan's economic and social development, Tang added.According to public release, the initiative mainly focuses on coordination in trade facilitation, but has limited substance in terms of liberalizing economic and trade activities, such as opening up investment and trade, which means that people on both sides will not profit from the possible outcome. The fact that the US has sent a delegation of more than 20 people to Taipei for face-to-face negotiations has been interpreted by some Taiwan-based media outlets as a sign of the rising importance of the Taiwan in the eyes of the US, and they inferred that the island will hold some bargaining power in this negotiation. However, this is entirely wishful thinking, experts said. ""The basic pattern of concessions from the Taiwan authorities to the US in this negotiation is unlikely to change, considering the unequal power and status of the two sides,"" Wang told the Global Times on Sunday. ""With the US currently hoping to use the island of Taiwan to suppress and confront the Chinese mainland, it is possible that the US will make concessions in some areas. But 'America first' would be the basic pattern of negotiations.""Observers noted that despite the fact that the talks would not lead to substantive results, the Taiwan authorities are still willing to engage in the negotiations because it is a much needed political show.The Chinese Foreign Ministry has sent warnings over this political maneuvering as early as June 2022, when the so-called initiative was first announced.""There is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory… If the US insists on playing the Taiwan card, it will only lead China-US relations to a dangerous situation,"" Zhao Lijian, former spokesperson for the ministry, said at the routine press conference.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also plans to talk with US President Joe Biden on January 13 after concluding his ongoing Europe and UK tour. 

A saga of diplomatic and military activities suggests that Tokyo and its allies are likely devising a more detailed and actual-combat strategic deployment against China, but China is always well-prepared to meet the challenge, analysts said.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida also plans to talk with US President Joe Biden on January 13 after concluding his ongoing Europe and UK tour. A saga of diplomatic and military activities suggests that Tokyo and its allies are likely devising a more detailed and actual-combat strategic deployment against China, but China is always well-prepared to meet the challenge, analysts said. Citing sources, Kyodo News reported on Monday (ET) that a Marine Littoral Regiment (MLR), will be established as part of a realignment of the Marine Corps in Japan's southwestern island prefecture, which is close to China's Taiwan region. The US plans to disperse US Marine units throughout Japan's Okinawa islands by 2026, equipping them with missiles and lighter gear to ""deter China's military,"" Reuters reported Tuesday, citing Japan's Yomiuri newspaper. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin called on Japan and the US to ensure their military cooperation does not harm the interests of third parties or regional peace and stability. We hope that relevant countries will respect the security concerns of countries in the region and do more to enhance mutual trust among countries as well as regional peace and stability, Wang said at a routine press conference on Tuesday. Japanese media said the plan is expected to be discussed at the 2023 US-Japan Security Consultative Committee, which also known as ""2+2"" security talks between foreign and defense ministers. Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, Defense Minister Yasukazu Hamada, and their US counterparts Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin are expected to attend the planned in-person meeting.Hyping China's ""increasing assertiveness,"" along with North Korea's missile testing and Russia-Ukraine conflict, Japanese media said that Tokyo hopes to articulate plans to acquire ""enemy base strike"" capability at the upcoming ""2+2"" security talks, with the Taiwan question to be discussed. Zhu Qingxiu, a Japanese studies researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times on Tuesday the possible discussion of MLR deployment at the ""2+2"" security talk indicates that the US and Japan may come up with more tactical deployments that focus on details and actual-combat level in the future. For instance, issues of resource allocation, a unified command structure, Japan's use of US military bases, and coordination of intelligence and reconnaissance are all likely to feature in the ""2+2"" security talks, Zhu noted. Japan's role in a possible conflict in the Taiwan Straits is likely to be discussed during the ""2+2"" meeting. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, top US Marine Corps general in Japan James Bierman said that US and Japanese armed forces are integrating their command structure and scaling up combined operations. Bierman told the Financial Times that in the recent joint drills, the Marines for the first time set up bilateral ground tactical co-ordination centers. Besides, specific Japanese military units have been designated as part of the ""stand-in force"" alongside US forces. Reuters said the Marines plan to cut aircraft numbers and dump most of cannon artillery and heavy amour in favor of smaller ""dispersed"" forces.The US plans to push Japan to the front line of the conflict so Japan takes the brunt of the attack so China could not wipe out US forces, Zhu said, noting this is also why US armed forces in the Western Pacific are showing a trend of dispersed deployments as Japan's national security strategy shifts to its southwestern islands. In fact, in Japan's three key defense documents revised in December, the Kishida administration pledged to strengthen Self-Defense Forces units in its southwestern islands, describing China as its ""greatest strategic challenge."" As part of efforts to develop its counterstrike capabilities, Kishida's government has earmarked about $1.58 billion to procure US long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles in the draft budget for fiscal 2023 from April, Japanese media said. China is always well-prepared and observing Tokyo's and Washington's moves, Zhu said. ""Although Japan is trying to put pressure strategically on China by deploying forces near the Taiwan region, it cannot change the fact that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) are much stronger than Japan's [forces] in the region.""Developing ""counterstrike capabilities"" cannot form a deterrent to China, but will only be a sheer waste of Japanese taxpayers' money, analysts said.                          "
Politics,By GT staff reporters   |  2023/2/14 0:04:08,China vows to push rural vitalization comprehensively with launch of No.1 central document for 2023,"China published a key policy document known as the ""No.1 central document"" for 2023 on Monday evening, in which the world's second largest economy underlined its determination to ""comprehensively push"" rural vitalization with joint efforts of the Communist Party of China and the whole society, as well as speed up achieving rural modernization. ",https://www.globaltimes.cn/Portals/0/attachment/2022/2022-11-13/2a513599-23af-42da-9186-f498cd10335c.jpeg," China published a key policy document known as the ""No.1 central document"" for 2023 on Monday evening, in which the world's second largest economy underlined its determination to ""comprehensively push"" rural vitalization with joint efforts of the Communist Party of China and the whole society, as well as speed up achieving rural modernization. The document also introduced nine aspects of work on achieving the goals including securing agricultural supplies/production and strengthening rural infrastructure construction, an extension of last year's missions but also presenting new highlights.According to the document, it is necessary to unremittingly consider solving the ""agriculture, rural areas and farmers"" problems as the top priority of the whole Party's work, and give full play to the efforts of the whole Party and society to comprehensively promote rural vitalization and accelerate modernization of agriculture and rural areas. With the accelerated evolution of global changes of a scale unseen in a century, China's development has entered a period of coexistence of strategic opportunities, risks and challenges, with increasing uncertainties and unpredictable factors, it is extremely important to maintain the bedrock of ""agriculture, rural areas and farmers"" and does not allow for any mistake, the document said.  Li Guoxiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said that the document's emphasis on the importance of modernizing agriculture and rural areas echoes with the far-reaching development blueprint laid out by the 20th CPC National Congress report, which pointed out that ""the most challenging and arduous tasks we face in building a modern socialist China in all respects remain in our rural areas.""""China faces a number of grim challenges in rural revitalization, such as lack of talent and rural aging issues. The No.1 document is a booster of confidence and an institutional guarantee that could mobilize the strength of the Party and the society toward a common goal,"" Li said.According to Li, most of the policy priorities listed in this year's No.1 central document are a continuance of last year's, mirroring a high degree of pragmatism and efficiency which will be easier for the localities to facilitate relevant work.  This year's document listed nine aspects of key work that China will undertake in 2023 to push rural revitalization. The first mission is securing grain and important agricultural products' supplies and stable production, a reflection of the government's continued emphasis on food security in line with long-term strategy. Specifically, China will guarantee a total of more than 650 billion kilograms of grain output in 2023, Xinhua said. In last year's No.1 central document, China vowed to ensure food security by holding the people's rice bowl firmly in its own hands.According to Li, the importance of stabilizing agricultural production and ensuring supply has been elevated to ""an unprecedented strategic position"" in this year's No.1 document, as well as last year's, amid more unexpected natural disasters.The country's strengthening call for food security also came at a time when geopolitical tensions flared up across the world with military conflicts breaking out between Russia and Ukraine, while US-led protectionism has little signs of abating. In 2022, China produced 687 million tons of grain, up 3.68 million tons compared with the previous year, data revealed by the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Grain security is a bottom line both for economic development and people's livelihoods, which must not go wrong, Hu Qimu, deputy secretary general of digital-real economies integration forum 50, told the Global Times on Monday.It is expected that this notion will be raised repeatedly as one of the priorities of China's development pattern to balance development with security, Hu said.In this year's No.1 central document, the government also stressed a number of missions to push rural vitalization, such as strengthening agricultural infrastructure construction and consolidating support of agricultural science, technology and equipment, something which officials touched on in last year's document but didn't emphasize that strongly.In particular, officials are looking to build an agricultural science and technology innovation system with clear tier, division of labor/cooperation and moderate competition to accelerate breakthroughs in cutting-edge technologies, the document showed.The document also said that China will support the construction of national laboratories, manufacturing innovation centers and other platforms in the field of agriculture, as well as improve the stable support mechanism for basic research in agricultural science and technology.According to Hu, China's proportion of primary industry will decline compared with the secondary and tertiary industries, and therefore the agricultural industry must be transformed and upgraded to be more efficient, smart and collective to meet with this trend. Tian Yun, a Beijing-based economist told the Global Times on Monday that China's production expansion needs to rely more on the improvement of scientific and technological content. ""The current population structure or labor force structure of China determines that the agricultural modernization will rely more on mechanical equipment to replace the labor force and fine work supported by information and intelligence to improve the yield and quality of food,"" he noted.Besides, the document said China will keep the bottom line of preventing a large-scale return to impoverishment, accelerate the construction of an agricultural powerhouse, as well as broaden the channels for farmers to increase income.Experts also stressed that China's rural modernization has its own traits instead of blindly following the pattern of Western countries. ""The foundation of the Chinese modernization of agriculture and rural areas is to consolidate and improve the basic rural operation system, develop new rural collective economies and advance reform of the rural land system, and grant farmers more adequate property rights and interests, a divergence from the privatizing ownership of lands in the West,"" Li said.  ""China's rural land system ensures the rights of about 300 million farmers being guaranteed, and safeguards the lawful land rights and interests of rural residents who have moved to urban areas, otherwise they may be expelled from the cities and live in slums after losing their lands - a very common thing in the Western model,"" Li noted.                          "
