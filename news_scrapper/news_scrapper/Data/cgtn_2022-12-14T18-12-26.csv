The Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park was among the first batch of national parks established last year. The second batch of national parks is on the way.,At present, China has established nearly 10,000 nature reserves, accounting for around 18 percent of the nation's total landmass, said Ma Keping, the deputy director and secretary-general of the Biodiversity Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.,Meanwhile, China has taken the initiative to draw up ecological conservation red lines nationwide, covering zones that are critical to environmental function or are ecologically sensitive.,For example, the ecological conservation red lines drawn in areas including the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Yangtze River Basin protect the vast majority of rare and endangered species and their habitats, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.,Besides, China has also pushed for the integrated conservation and systematic restoration of mountains, rivers, forests, farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts in recent years. Thanks to the efforts, China's forest resources have increased by more than 70 million hectares in the past decade, ranking first in the world.,While steadily on its way in pursuing a beautiful China, the world's largest developing and most populated country also showed support for international efforts in biodiversity protection worldwide.,China was among the first to sign and ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity and it has fulfilled the obligations stipulated in the Convention.,In recent years, China has also cooperated with other countries on biodiversity protection and such cooperation has yielded fruitful results.,For example, the China-Laos cross-border Biodiversity Joint Conservation Area has reached 200,000 hectares, effectively protecting rare and endangered species such as the Asian elephants and their habitats, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.,Mentioning Kenya's Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment said the railway is equipped with large animal passages, bridges and culverts to ensure the free movement of wildlife.,There are still many more stories to be written on China's experiences and solutions in advancing global biodiversity protection.,At the second phase of the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (COP15), which kicked off on December 7 in Canada, China remains as the president of the conference with the continued theme of ""Ecological Civilization: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth."" ,At the opening, Huang Runqiu, president of COP15 and China's minister of ecology and environment, called for international cooperation to achieve the ""landmark outcome of the conference,"" the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, which aims to halt and reverse biodiversity losses by 2030.,The first phase of COP15 was held last October in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, at which Kunming Declaration was adopted, laying a solid political foundation for the second phase of COP15."
'New Approaches': Hospitals gear up to prioritize COVID-19 patients,"

            ","To echo China's new guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and control, local governments and hospitals across the country have been optimizing medical services and the allocation of medical resources to face a likely surge in patients and take better care of the elderly and most vulnerable groups.,On November 11, the country announced 20 new COVID-19 prevention and control measures. On top of that, another 10 new measures were published on December 7 to further optimize China's COVID-19 control policy.,The measures require enhancing medical resources to prioritize COVID-19 patients.,As the latest Omicron variants spread rapidly with strong transmissibility, some hospitals in major cities, including Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan, have seen people waiting in lines for hours to enter fever clinics. ,To avoid panic and a squeeze on medical resources, local governments and hospitals are upgrading existing temporary hospitals, adding ICU beds and better distributing medical resources. ,China built temporary hospitals to receive and treat COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms and cut off the spread of the virus. With the relaxation of COVID-19 control and prevention measures, more temporary hospitals have been upgraded and transformed into sub-designated city-level hospitals based on the size of each city's population.,Jiao Yahui, director general of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission, said at a press conference on December 9 that the sub-designated hospitals would treat patients rather than just isolating them as the mobile cabin hospitals did. She also said 10 percent of the beds in these hospitals would be transformed into intensive care unit (ICU) beds. ,""There are 138,100 ICU beds in China, of which 106,500 are in top-tier medical institutions. On average, there are 10 ICU beds for every 100,000 people,"" Jiao said.,Experts have also been providing educational information to the public about the virus and asking asymptomatic patients and patients with mild symptoms not to cause a run on hospitals or jam up the emergency number 120 to keep the medical resources available for possible severe cases. ,Many hospitals across the country have already begun changing their approach.  ,Lu Wei, a urologist with a district hospital in southwest China's Chongqing, told CGTN that a temporary hospital that the district hospital built to separate and treat COVID-19 patients is expected to be decommissioned soon, along with the national policy changes.  ,""It was not easy for hundreds of patients and medical staff to be restricted in the temporary hospital built in a suburb away from their families,"" said Lu. ""It's especially hard when they stay there for a longer time."",Lu said rather than keeping the temporary hospital open, the district hospital will instead expand its existing fever-treating department into a designated zone for COVID-19 patients. Doctors from other departments can also be assigned to treat their patients in this zone, and no excessive quarantine is required.,Patients with other illnesses will no longer be required to do a COVID-19 test, only elderly patients will be tested for the virus, and special attention will be paid to them if the results are positive, Lu said. ,Beijing has also set up new fever clinics and consulting rooms or expanded existing ones, requiring all hospitals at the second level and higher and qualified primary medical institutions to set up fever clinics. ,In many places, including Beijing and east China's Zhejiang Province, multiple hospitals have opened special online services for COVID-19 treatment so that patients with symptoms can make inquiries online. ,Hospitals in Shanghai have opened a special admission channel to receive patients whose nucleic acid test or antigen test results were abnormal. ,""We have set up different areas and provided different channels for different groups of patients to ensure all the patients can receive medical care timely.

"Study finds genetic solution to pre-harvest sprouting in rice, wheat","

    09:00, 08-Dec-2022

            ","A new Chinese scientific study has identified a combination of two crop genes that are in charge of controlling seed dormancy and could be used to reduce the costly phenomenon of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) in crops such as rice and wheat.,Seed dormancy is an important survival tool for plants, allowing them to survive in negative weather conditions. However, excessive dormancy may shorten cultivation time, so many farmers like to plant low-dormancy species of rice and wheat to get a high rate of seed emergence after sowing.,This practice can lead to PHS, a worldwide production problem in which grains germinate on the mother plant before harvest time and often during wet weather, severely reducing grain yield and quality.,Researchers from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB) under the Chinese Academy of Sciences have identified two genes, namely SD6 and ICE2, which act in combination to control seed dormancy and have great potential for reducing PHS in rice and wheat.,They found that SD6 and its interaction partner ICE2 can antagonistically control rice seed dormancy by regulating plant hormones. Specifically, SD6 can promote the expression of the catabolic hormones and inhibit the expression of the anabolic hormones, while ICE2 acts in the opposite manner.,In the study, when seeds were at room temperature, SD6 was up-regulated to trigger seed germination. However, at low temperatures, SD6 was down-regulated, but ICE2 was up-regulated to keep the seed dormant.,The researchers edited SD6 in three rice species and found that editing the gene could be a rapid and useful strategy for improving PHS tolerance in rice. They then edited the genes in a wheat variety, showing that this provided a similar resistance to PHS.,The study results were published in the journal Nature Genetics on Monday.,Lead researcher Chu Chengcai said the findings were crucial to avoiding huge agricultural losses and ensuring food security. He cited China as an example, saying that PHS had damaged about 6 percent of conventional rice acreage and 20 percent of hybrid rice acreage during the harvest season in the south of the country.,Global climate change has worsened the problem, according to the researcher, who said that many wheat and rice planting regions in the middle and lower Yangtze River valley have suffered more frequently in recent years.,The new study is the latest example of China's intensified research efforts to ensure food security. Scientists believe the discovery of the two genes can help crop seeds overcome natural seasonal changes and ensure successful reproduction. "

They nest in trees to hatch their eggs. Predators aren't their only concern. They must also compete with their own kind. In the fight between female mergansers, chicks are the prize, with the winner claiming all the hatchlings to compensate for any she has lost.,Spread across five distinct climate zones, the Qinling Mountains have the most diverse range of species in central China.

Golden takin families move together with infants at the center, nursed by their mothers and aunties.,Asian elephants reign in the Xishuangbanna rainforest. The herd is led by the eldest female. The matriarch takes care of the family and finds the best routes through the forest. In such a matrilineal society, males leave the herd upon reaching maturity. Though reluctant to go, they know it's time to strike out on their own.,Green peafowls dwell in Ailao Mountain National Nature Reserve, though their size limits their flying range.

If your answer is yes, this article may surprise you.,The land connection via rail links is already taking place place, via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), in some parts of the world: Eurasia and Southeast Asia.,In Eurasia, by December 2022, the number of trains dispatched between China and Europe carrying everyday commercial goods had hit over 1,500. The China-Europe Rail Freight Link under the BRI has 82 different routes so far and connects 196 cities from 24 countries in Europe.,In Southeast Asia, the ,, for which China is responsible for most of the investment and construction, connects cities in China and Laos. It is the first railway in the previously landlocked Laos. Being landlocked was one main reason the country remains impoverished compared to coastal nations. Ever since the railway began operation in December 2021, the value of goods being transported by rail exceed 10 billion yuan ($1.43 billion) in nine months, according to statistics from Kunming Customs.,Laos is now land-linked. ,In November 2022, the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway, the first in Indonesia and Southeast Asia completed testing.

In 2016, Xi made a trip to Egypt and Iran after first visiting Saudi Arabia, which signified a sharp contrast to former U.S. President Donald Trump who, during his visit to the Gulf kingdom, touted the idea of creating an ""Arab NATO,"" portrayed Iran as a common enemy to the Middle East and provoked more tensions in the region.,The key to addressing differences is to enhance dialogue; The key to overcoming difficulties is to accelerate development; The key to choosing a right path is to make sure that it suits national conditions, Xi said at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo during his 2016 trip.,Reflecting on that trip, Li said China can draw on its close relations with Arab countries to help resolve disputes among them. While the West only propagates ""democracy"" and ""freedom"" and has brought persistent conflicts to the Middle East, China and Arab states are bound by tacit understanding, and the trust between them, as Xi put it, is unbreakable, nor can it be bought by money.,(Cover: This photo taken on December 7, 2022 shows jets releasing smoke in the colors of the Chinese national flag in the sky over Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. /Xinhua)"

The current priorities in our work are as follows:   ,First, strengthen unified leadership. We need to ensure a coordinated national response. Party committees and governments at all levels must follow the unified command, coordination and arrangements of the Party's central leadership to ensure proper execution of orders.  ,Second, strengthen virus prevention and control in key regions. Only when we succeed in bringing this virus under control in key regions can we turn the tide across the country. We must focus on coordinating prevention and treatment forces across regions, pool medical resources and protective equipment on the front line, and prioritize the needs of medical workers and patients.  ,Third, increase the admission and cure rates and reduce the infection and fatality rates, which is currently our crucial task. Hospitals solely for admitting and treating coronavirus patients should be completed and brought into service as soon as possible. ,Fourth, redouble our efforts in scientific research. It is essential that we scientifically determine the origin of the virus, identify the infection sources and transmission routes as quickly as possible, keep close track of virus mutations, and develop the appropriate response strategies and measures…With regard to the R&D of vaccines and medicines, it is recommended to incentivize universities, research institutes and companies, and to combine R&D with clinical practice and virus prevention and control to accelerate this science-based process.  ,(Source: Part of the speech at a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 19th CPC Central Committee on novel coronavirus response, February 3, 2020.

'Shared by Nature': How to better facilitate the conservation of land and sea areas on Earth,"

            ","The second phase of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP15) is ongoing in Montreal, Canada, between December 7 and 19. The conference is expected to lead to the adoption of the ""Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework"". One of the targets in the first draft of the Framework is that at least 30 percent of land areas and sea areas on Earth are conserved effectively before 2030.,CGTN talked to Professor Marie-Josée Fortin, who specializes in spatial ecology at the University of Toronto. She shared her views on better approaches to facilitating the conservation of both areas from a spatial planning perspective.,First, focus on the combination of several ecosystems rather than a single one, such as forests, which could create an area that is ""contiguous from terrestrial to streams to oceans,"" she said. Then ""a continuum across ecosystem and a more healthy environment"" would be established for species that require freshwater and seawater, such as salmon.,To offer more protection for specific species in the ocean, Professor Fortin shared a tool by establishing a network of marine protected areas. Scientists first have access to the ""trajectories of species in the present times and the future times. Then they model with some kind of optimization algorithms to identify where could be the area that maximizes the number of species in the current time and in the future."" These areas are part of the network. Also, scientists look at the overlap, which are considered the protected areas as well. Therefore, the habitat for species, such as their mating, spawning and feeding grounds, would be well protected.,In addition, the shape of the protected areas matters. ""For the ocean, rectangular shapes are used to maximize the range of marine ecosystems that exist from coastal areas to deeper areas. On land, it is better to have round areas as there is less edge effect and more interior area for species that require large habitat areas,"" she said.,The professor also expressed her expectations to the conference that international collaboration and reaching an agreement between countries are significant to conserve biodiversity globally. ,(Cover image designed by CGTN's Li Wenyi, video edited by CGTN's Xu Wen)"

""The sci-tech cooperation is the bridge and bond linking us. I hope Ms Wu could build a channel for us to undertake exchanges with our counterparts in Taiwan region."",Besides her pursuits in biotechnology, Wu also helps treat children diagnosed with leukemia from underprivileged families on the mainland. And it all started with a boy named Haoyu.,""It happened very suddenly when a doctor surnamed Luo called me to ask if I could help a boy (named Haoyu) struggling with leukemia. He was just over a year old and would have died in just three months as his family could not afford his treatment,"" Wu recalled.,""Without hesitation, I offered my help,"" Wu continued.,After a visit to Haoyu at the hospital, Wu and her team decided to set up a project named ""Little Cells of Love"" in 2013 to aid underprivileged children suffering from leukemia. Since then, the project has helped save 279 children.,""We do not have the strength to save so many children, but we are trying our best,"" Wu said.,The project not only raises funds but also people's awareness of bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow donation nowadays has become similar to blood donation thanks to advanced technology, Wu explained.,""Peace across the Taiwan Straits benefits all.

            ","In the fierce battle against COVID-19, the Chinese people and the Chinese nation have shown extraordinary mettle and fought courageously for victory. While fighting the virus, we have put life above all else, rallied the entire country, braved danger, respected science and stood together through adversity.,Putting life above all else embodies the Chinese people's deep-rooted tradition of compassion and the people-centered philosophy of China's Communists. As an ancient Chinese philosopher said, ""Compassion means loving and helping others."" Human compassion will prevail over the merciless virus. Life is the most precious of all things, for we only live once; once lost, life can never be restored. When lives are at stake, we must protect them at all costs, a promise we are capable of delivering because the fundamental mission of our Party is to serve the people wholeheartedly, and because ours is a socialist country run by the people. We took the decisive step of closing outbound traffic from Wuhan City and the rest of Hubei Province, and put in place control measures unprecedented in their stringency. This was a decision that required enormous political courage and a strong sense of responsibility, but we were prepared to do whatever it took to protect the lives of the people. From newborn babies just 30 hours old to elderly people over the age of 100, and from international students to other foreign expatriates in the country, every life was fully protected, valued and respected. All this best illustrates the people-centered governance philosophy of our Party, the Chinese ethos and ethics that human life is invaluable, and the Chinese people's reverence for life.,Respecting science embodies the Chinese character of pragmatism and innovation. Faced with an unknown infectious disease, we maintained a rational mindset and attitude, and followed the laws of science in all respects and throughout the process of decision-making, treatment, research and social governance.,Standing together through adversity embodies the Chinese people's love for peace, and commitment to looking out for others. A noble cause is never a lonely pursuit, and compassion knows no borders. Upholding the belief that all countries are members of one and the same family, we take responsibility for the lives and health of the Chinese people; we also make due contribution to global public health security. We have launched the most wide-ranging and intense emergency humanitarian assistance campaign since the founding of the PRC in 1949, and have contributed to the global fight against COVID-19 on an ongoing basis. China has proved to be a responsible major country that honors its word, values friendship, upholds justice, and champions integrity – a country committed to pursuing a more harmonious world and building a global community of shared future.,Just as inner strength is indispensable for individuals, it is also essential for nations. Indeed, only with inner strength can a nation stand tall and firm while weathering the tide of challenging times. The ability to overcome difficulties demands not only material resources but also an indomitable will. The great spirit that we have forged in the battle against COVID-19 is deeply rooted in the character of the Chinese nation and our cultural genes. It carries and builds on patriotism, collectivism, and socialism, and illustrates and enriches the ethos of both our nation and our times. We should promote this great spirit in our society and turn it into a powerful force for building a modern socialist country and realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.,(Source: Part of Xi Jinping's speech at a national meeting honoring heroes in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, September 8, 2020)"

In 2013, China launched the BRI to enhance global connectivity, communication and cooperation, and foster a more balanced and equitable world system.,In his meetings with Arab states' leaders, Xi pledged that China would further work with Arab states to deepen and expand exchanges and cooperation in various fields, including energy, infrastructure, medical care, aviation, finance, 5G communication, e-commerce and marine economy.,He pointed out several countries' national development strategies, including Saudi Vision 2030, Middle East Green Initiative, Kuwait Vision 2035, Djibouti Vision 2035, Qatar National Vision 2030 and Emerging Comoros Plan for 2030, saying that China will further align China's development policies and the implementation of the outcomes of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum and Forum on China-Africa Cooperation with these states' development strategies, to bring cooperation between China and Arab states to a new and higher level.,Xi said China would continue to provide developing Arab states with assistance within its capacity, and encourages Chinese enterprises to invest so as to improve local people's livelihood and boost their economic and social development.,During his meetings with Arab states' leaders, Xi pledged that China would continue to cooperate with its Arab counterparts in fields including anti-terrorism and poverty eradication. ,Over the years, China has assisted Mauritania in advancing road, bridge, hospital and other major projects that benefit people's wellbeing, Xi emphasized, adding that China will continue to encourage Chinese enterprises to take an active part in Mauritania's energy, infrastructure and other sectors to bring benefit to the Mauritanian people.,Acknowledging the Somali government's task of fighting terrorists, Xi said China supports the Somali government in enhancing its ability to maintain stability and fight against terrorism. ,Noting China has carried out a number of health, sports and human resources training projects in recent years in Tunisia, Xi said China is ready to steadily advance cooperation with Tunisia in such areas as healthcare, infrastructure and high and new technologies, expand exchanges between human resources as well as local and non-governmental exchanges, and welcome more marketable products and specialties from Tunisia to China.,China and Arab states have strengthened cooperation in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Bahrain was one of the first countries in the world to approve a Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine.,China would also like to enhance medical and health cooperation, and promote the Chinese language education in Bahrain, Xi said.,(Cover: A view of Egyptian and Chinese construction site at the ongoing works at the business and finance district of Egypt's New Administrative Capital, August 3, 2021. /CFP)"

            ","Some stereotypes have narrowed China-Arab cooperation to only oil and gas, but in reality the partnership stretches far beyond. ,China, Arabs states' cooperation on technologies of the future – like Huawei's 5G, BeiDou satellite navigation, artificial intelligence (AI), new materials, bio-pharmaceuticals, smart cities, astronaut training and space exploration – is flourishing. A newly released document titled ""Report on China-Arab Cooperation in a New Era"" said agriculture, investment and financing, and hi-tech industries were key sectors for future China-Arab cooperation.,In recent years, public health has become a new cooperative field between China and Arab states. At the early stage of COVID-19 vaccine research and development, the UAE firm G42 teamed up with Chinese Sinopharm to begin vaccine trials in the UAE. UAE is keen to use its close ties with neighboring countries to deliver the China-UAE produced vaccines and other healthcare products to third countries. The UAE firm G42 has already been delivering vaccines to Egypt, Morocco and Bahrain. G42 is also in cooperation with Sinopharm to help Serbia build its own vaccine manufacturing capacity. "

"Africa: A Place for International Cooperation, Not for Major-power Competition— Transcript of Ambassador Qin Gang’s Fireside Talk At the Semafor Africa Summit","

    11:02, 14-Dec-2022

            ","On December 12, Ambassador Qin Gang had a fireside talk with Steve Clemons, Editor-at-large of Semafor, at the Semafor Africa Summit. The transcript of their talk is as follows:, ,Ambassador, kind of looking at the global strategic dashboard of China, where does Africa fit in that?,First of all, thank you, Steve, for having me on the Semafor Africa Summit. This is a very important summit, just before the second US-Africa Summit. I wish the Summit successful in gathering international attention and support for Africa. So back to your first question.,Africa is a young, promising land. China-Africa friendship is deep-seated and has a long history. It's very popular in China. If you ask a foreign minister of China, whoever he is or she is, he or she must tell you that Africa is important. China-Africa relations are the bedrock of China’s foreign policy. I give you an example. Every foreign minister, since 20 years ago, will visit African countries at the beginning of every year. The visit to Africa is the first outgoing visit of Chinese foreign minister. So that can tell how much importance we attach (to China-Africa relations). , Is that something that you, as you look at the other global stakeholders, the United States, are you putting higher priority on Africa from your perspective than, say, the United States or other nations?,Our relationship with Africa is sincere, is out of consideration to help Africa in its efforts for peace, security and development. We are not interested in the views of any other countries on China's role in Africa. And we believe that Africa should be a place for international cooperation, not for major-power competition for geopolitical gains. We welcome all other members of the international community, including the United States, to join us in the global efforts to help Africa. I hope that the forthcoming Africa-US Summit will come up with more concrete and workable measures.,But one of the concerns that some have had regarding China's approach to Africa is the so-called “Chinese debt trap” or “debt trap diplomacy”, that China will come in and become the financing backbone of large infrastructure projects, take collateral of those infrastructure projects that won't work well, and then China will use this to secure greater geopolitical influence. What are your thoughts? I mean, I assume that you may have a different view, but what are your views on the Chinese debt trap question?,China's investment and financing assistance to Africa is not a trap. It's a benefit. Over the past decades, China has provided loans to help Africa with economic and social development. Construction works are everywhere in Africa. You can see hospitals, highways, airports, stadiums. Obviously, there is no such trap. It is not a plot. It is transparent, it is sincere. This is obvious.,I will give you a figure in terms of debts. China is not the biggest creditor of African debts. According to the World Bank, 49 African countries, as far as the data can be obtained, owes about $700 billion ($696 billion) debts. Among them, three quarters are owed to multinational institutions and non-Chinese private lenders. The debts owed to China are only a small amount. And according to “Debt Justice”, a UK-based charity, African countries owe three times more debts to Western private lenders than they owe to China, and their interest rates are double. So China is not the largest creditor. And also China understands the debt situation. China wants to help African countries to get out of poverty and to work for their economic and social development. There is a concern about that issue during the pandemic. We see at the G20, there is an arrangement which is called the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. China is an active member, and China participates in this initiative. China has suspended the most debt service payment among G20 members. And China will continue to participate beyond this initiative. We are participating, and we will participate in the debt treatment for individual countries. And also we call on all other creditors, multinational institutions, and private lenders to take active actions, to reduce the debt burden of African countries in the principle of fair burden sharing and common actions., I'm gonna get to climate change real quick, but I want to tell little fun vignette that you offered at a panda ceremony —the 50th anniversary of the panda program, pandas in the United States and China. You made the comment that the pandas are no longer near extinction, that they have now reached a certain level of being able to populate the world, that they are now not of that endangered species, but you said those that are endangered are panda huggers, meaning those that appreciate China. And I want to ask this with regards to US-China tensions and big questions like climate change. How did the Biden-Xi summit in Bali set a floor on US-China relations? And are they moving up? And is the climate meeting that we just had in Sharm El Sheikh where Chinese negotiators Xie Zhenhua recently said that the talks with John Kerry were candid, friendly, positive and active. Overall, it has been very positive. It sounds very different, in fact, than the tone we had seen just a month ago. Have US-China relations in terms of dealing with global problems changed?,First of all, about panda, I know African people like pandas also, and I believe that in Africa you can see most panda-huggers., Would you be willing to offer them? We can do a deal here.,Let's think about it, right?,About China-US relations, yes, that's been going downhill over the past few years. This is because that with the fast development of China, there are misunderstandings and misperceptions of China in the United States, which have resulted in a policy that is very harsh and very unfriendly to China.,Last month, President Xi and President Biden had a successful meeting in Bali during the G20 Summit. The two presidents had a very in-depth and candid exchange of views and opinions on bilateral relations and on the pressing global and regional issues. They made very important common understandings, that is both sides need to do something to calm down the tension, to step up communications and dialogue, and to expand cooperation. They have identified some priority areas for interactions, including climate, public health, agriculture, food security, macroeconomic policy coordination. The meeting was effective to relax the tension and give people a sign of relief. There are lots of things to follow up. We hope that both sides can act on the serious commitments by the two presidents. It’s a whole-process matter, not only nice words and serious promises during the meeting. And we are paying more attention to the deeds, what will come up, how the United States will treat China, and what the United States will do on China in the future., It sounds like it was a very good US-China meeting. But were you disappointed that more was not achieved to help developing nations in the course of responding to climate change and in dealing with climate change?, I think the international community needs to have more attention and input to tackle the climate issue, because it is a global challenge. As far as China is concerned, we not only talk, but also walk the walk. At home, we have announced two goals, that is to achieve carbon peak before the year 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. So these goals are our serious commitments. We will honor them. We have already published a roadmap and action plans to realize the two goals. Internationally, we participate actively in helping the developing world, particularly African countries, to combat climate change. For example, China initiated the Global Cooperation Partnership on Clean Energy. The first batch of projects will go to 19 African countries. Now, China is helping African countries to develop clean energies, wind and solar ones. And we are building low-carbon demonstration zones in some African countries.,China will not shirk its responsibility, but we also call on the developed countries, including the United States to honor their commitment. For example, developed countries have pledged to provide 100 billion US dollars as green finance every year to developing countries. But many years have passed, and this pledge hasn't been honored. And the United States has announced during COP26 to provide three billion dollars every year to the most fragile, vulnerable countries, most of them sub-Saharan countries. We hope that the United States will also act on its words to provide effective and concrete assistance, technology, expertise and capability building, to developing countries.,We're right near the end of our time. And I want to ask you while we have a chance, that as you in your role here in Washington managing the relationship between China and the United States, do you see areas that we're not developing? I know we're competing. I know that the President has said we're not necessarily on a collision course. I don't know how you see it if we are in a collision course. But are there areas that we're not developing, where China and the United States, perhaps with regards to Africa or other parts of the world, should be cooperating?, Good question. China and the United States are both major countries and permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations. So both countries share common responsibilities for not only the benefit of the people but also the future of the world. There are lots of areas, projects that China and the United States can work on together. People want to see China and the United States do so. That's the international expectation. We need to bear in mind our important responsibilities and be mindful of the international aspiration to expand cooperation and dialogue on a wide range of issues, not only the everyday exchange of harsh words, exchange of attacks, smearing on China, so on and so forth. We need to extend, broaden our vision and expand our cooperation in Africa. This is one of the very interesting areas for the two countries to work on.,In recent years, we have had good examples. For example, in 2015, China and the United States together helped African countries like Liberia to fight against Ebola. It is a good example. Several good economic projects in Africa are jointly participated by China, the United States and African countries. There's a textile industry park in Ethiopia that is jointly sponsored, built and operated by China, the United States and Ethiopia. It's very productive, and exports garments to Europe and North American markets. That's very successful. I hope that we can work with the United States on peace, security and prosperity in Africa.,Ambassador, it looks like China is opening up perhaps a little bit, relaxing COVID a little bit. So two questions: Can we all visit Beijing and shanghai soon? Two, did the protests make a difference? Did the government feel the stress and intention of the protesters with regard to COVID?, I think that the government is taking a very responsible attitude to protecting people's lives facing the threat of COVID. And our response policy and its measures have always been dynamic, not rigid, just lockdown or asking people to confine to their homes. That's not true. We know people's concerns. We know the importance of the coordination of COVID response and economic growth. So that's why we are making dynamic re-adjustment to our response measures. Now, the measures are being relaxed. And in the near future, I believe that the measures will be further relaxed, and international travel will become easier., From Africa and the United States?, From all the directions to China.,Ambassador Qin Gang, thank you so much for joining us today.,Thank you."

            ","Chen Wen-cheng, a 33-year-old physical education (PE) teacher at Peking University, bought his first apartment, got a car license plate and became the father of his second child in 2022. The young man from China's Taiwan region couldn't ask for more for his 10th year in the Chinese capital.,When Chen came to Beijing in 2012 to study, he didn't see himself getting so deeply rooted. ""I was just myself back then; now it's a family of four,"" Chen said. ""No need for my parents in Taiwan to worry about me anymore."",Born in Taiwan's Changhua County, Chen has always loved sports. He was in the basketball squad in middle school. In high-school, friends would call him ""fleet-footed"" because he could run 100 meters in 11.3 seconds. Not surprisingly, physical education became his major in college.,Chen would frequently visit the running track, swimming pool, basketball and volleyball courts, and the gymnastics stadium to practice every sport he could. ""You name it, even martial arts, I learned everything,"" Chen said.,In 2010, Chen participated in a cross-Strait event in which students from Peking University joined their peers in Taiwan, biking around the island for nine days. That event ignited Chen's yearning for an adventure in Beijing.,""They shared tons of stories about Beijing, which attracted me right away,"" Chen said. ""I decided to find a chance to go there."",In 2012, Chen got admitted in Beijing Sport University for a master's degree. However, his family was worried over his choice of studying so far away. ""They wanted me to stay close but I think it was worth taking the risk since I was young,"" Chen explained.,After obtaining his master's degree, Chen also did his PhD from the same university and then joined Peking University as a postdoctoral researcher.,Meanwhile, Chen also began to explore Beijing and introduce it to others. He arranged tours to local heritage parks for people from both the mainland and Taiwan region. On a nice day, they would go zigzagging on bikes in the city's iconic alleyways called hutongs.,""Sports is truly the best way to connect people,"" Chen noted.,""We even hosted curling competitions for teenagers from Taiwan and Beijing during the Winter Olympics season. They became great friends after that."",Chen believes sports exchanges between the people across the Taiwan Straits can help both sides know more about each other and find their mutual roots.,""When I went to Xiamen to run for a marathon, I heard a familiar dialect and ate local food that was similar to the one in my hometown,"" Chen said. ""I deeply felt we're one family."",Chen is also a promoter of skyballing, a novel sport that originated in Taiwan region. With a claw-like racket and a light-weight plastic ball, players throw the ball out in the movement similar to pitching a baseball for the opponent to catch it.,Chen set up a skyball club at the Beijing Sport University and organized dozens of classes in parks to promote it. Chen and his wife, a fellow postgraduate scholar from Henan Province and now a primary school PE teacher, wrote textbooks about skyballing for local schools.,Chen's interest in the Chinese mainland isn't confined to Beijing. From Tibet Autonomous Region in the southwest to the northernmost province of Heilongjiang, Chen has visited over 20 provinces, municipalities and regions nationwide in the past decade.,The experience has brought him profound understanding of the mainland.

Ninety-nine percent of those infected can recover in 7 to 10 days, and having a good rest is conducive to the recovery, he added.,Zhong said the death rate from the variant is almost the same as that of influenza (the flu), and that the ""sequelae"" of COVID-19, which need to be observed from the clinical perspective, should be viewed objectively.,He noted that the risk of sequelae caused by Omicron has been significantly reduced compared with the Delta strain, and asymptomatic carriers were basically free of COVID-19 sequelae.,It is critical to impose the , announced by the State Council to further optimize the prevention and control of COVID-19, he noted, adding that the measures need to be implemented scientifically to prevent secondary disasters and minimize the impact on people's livelihoods. ,As part of efforts to optimize nucleic acid testing, people will not be subjected to mass testing according to administrative regions, according to the newly released measures. ,People can take a COVID-19 antigen self-test if they want to, instead of a nucleic acid test, noted Zhong. ,.,Zhong said the vaccination rate of the whole population needs to be increased, particularly among the elderly.

Full text of Chinese President Xi's signed article on Saudi Arabian media,"

    03:50, 08-Dec-2022

            ","A signed article by Chinese President Xi Jinping titled ""Carrying Forward Our Millennia-old Friendship and Jointly Creating a Better Future"" was published Thursday on Saudi Arabian newspaper Al Riyadh. President Xi is in Riyadh to attend the first China-Arab States Summit, the China-Gulf Cooperation Council Summit and pay a state visit to Saudi Arabia. ,The following is the full text of the article: ,Carrying Forward Our Millennia-old Friendship and Jointly Creating a Better Future ,Xi Jinping ,President of the People's Republic of China ,I am coming back to Riyadh, bringing with me profound friendship from the Chinese people. I am here to join my Arab friends for the first China-Arab States Summit and the first China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit and to pay a state visit to Saudi Arabia. Designed as a trip of building on the past and more importantly, of opening up a better future, the visit will carry forward our traditional friendship, and usher in a new era in China's relations with the Arab world, with Arab states of the Gulf, and with Saudi Arabia. ,The exchanges between China and Arab states date back more than 2,000 years. The constant streams of caravans along the land Silk Road and the billowing sails along the maritime Spice Road have born witness to how the Chinese and Arab civilizations interacted with and inspired each other across the Asian continent. It was through these exchanges that Chinese porcelain and paper-making and printing techniques were introduced to the West while Arab astronomy, calendar and medicine went all the way to the East. We have traded goods, sparked innovation, shared ideas, and spread the fruits of cultural exchanges to the rest of the world, leaving a splendid chapter in East-West engagement and mutual learning. ,The contacts between China and Arab states of the Gulf are well documented. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220), Gan Ying, a Chinese emissary, was sent to the ""western seas"", namely the Persian Gulf, to look for the Roman Empire. This is the first official record of Chinese envoys reaching Arab states of the Gulf. More than 1,200 years ago, an Arab navigator, Abu Obeida, sailed from Sohar Port to the Chinese city of Guangzhou on a legendary journey that was later adapted to the exciting and well-known adventures of Sindbad. In the 1980s, a replica ship named the Sohar retraced the route opened by ancient Arab navigators, connecting the past and present friendly interactions between the two sides. ,China and Saudi Arabia have admired each other and conducted friendly exchanges since ancient times. The prophet Muhammad said, ""Seek knowledge even if you have to go as far as China."" Seven hundred years ago, Wang Dayuan, a Chinese traveler of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), made a pilgrimage to Mecca which he described as a place with beautiful scenery, mild weather, fertile rice fields, and a happy people in his book ,. It was an important book from which the Chinese learned about Saudi Arabia at that time. Six hundred years ago, Zheng He, a Chinese navigator of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), reached Jeddah and Medina on his oceangoing voyages, leaving behind him many stories of friendship and exchanges that are still widely told today. The joint Chinese-Saudi archaeological excavation of the ruins of the al Serrian port conducted in recent years has unearthed many porcelain wares of China's Song and Yuan dynasties (960-1368). They stand as testaments to all those friendly interactions. ,The Arab world is an important member of the developing world and a key force for upholding international fairness and justice. The Arab people value independence, oppose external interference, stand up to power politics and high-handedness, and always seek to make progress. Arab states are endowed with diverse resources, and have built industries with distinctive features, scored remarkable achievements in development, and demonstrated enormous potentials. The Arab civilization advocates the middle way and moderation, encourages inclusiveness and mutual learning, opposes clash of civilizations, and is deeply rooted in its rich culture and history. Be it on the world political, economic or cultural map, Arab states always claim an important place. ,Since the 1950s, China has established diplomatic relations with all Arab states. Their interactions feature mutual understanding, mutual respect, mutual assistance and solidarity. They have become good friends treating each other as equals, good partners pursuing mutual benefit, and good brothers sharing weal and woe. In the 21st century, China-Arab relations have continued to move ahead against a fluid international landscape, and achieved historic leapfrog growth in political trust, mutually beneficial economic cooperation, and cultural mutual learning in both breadth and depth. ,In the past decade, China-Arab relations entered a new era and registered a series of landmark and groundbreaking achievements in various areas. Collectively, China has established a future-oriented strategic partnership of comprehensive cooperation and common development with all Arab states. Individually, China has established comprehensive strategic partnership or strategic partnership with 12 Arab states, and signed documents on Belt and Road cooperation with 20 Arab states. Among Arab countries, 17 have expressed support for the Global Development Initiative (GDI), 15 have become members of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and 14 have participated in the China-League of Arab States Cooperation Initiative on Data Security.  ,Arab states firmly support the one-China principle and support China in safeguarding its core interests. Likewise, China supports Arab states in upholding sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. On issues such as the Palestinian question, China's firm support for Arab states has been consistent and unwavering. Major infrastructure projects jointly built by the two sides, including the Djamaa El Djazair mosque of Algeria, the Lusail Stadium of Qatar, the new headquarters of the Central Bank of Kuwait, as well as the Merowe Dam, the Roseires Dam heightening, and the Upper Atbara Dams Complex Project of Sudan, have become landmarks of China-Arab friendship. China has set up 20 Confucius institutes and two Confucius classrooms in Arab states. And over 40 Chinese universities teach Arabic as a major, contributing inexhaustible energy for growing China-Arab friendship. ,Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and Arab states have come to each other's aid and navigated through the difficulties together. The two sides have carried out efficient cooperation in such areas as vaccine research and application, joint epidemic prevention and control, experience sharing, medical services and pharmaceuticals, setting a fine example of solidarity in fighting the virus. Under the framework of China-Arab States Cooperation Forum, 17 cooperation mechanisms have been launched to expand and substantiate the cooperation agenda, giving a strong boost to China-Arab relations and providing a paradigm for the solidarity and cooperation among developing countries.  ,The world is now undergoing momentous changes unseen in a century. Both China and Arab states face the historic mission of realizing national rejuvenation and speeding up national development. In this new context, China will work with Arab states to carry forward the traditional friendship and jointly build a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era. China and Arab states will continue to hold high the banner of non-interference in internal affairs, firmly support each other in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity, and jointly uphold international fairness and justice. We will continue to enhance together Belt and Road cooperation, keep expanding practical cooperation in such areas as food, energy, investment, financing and medical services, and pursue mutually beneficial cooperation with higher quality and in greater depth. We will continue to jointly act on the GDI and the Global Security Initiative so as to stabilize volatile regions and contribute more positive energy to peace and development. We will continue to jointly advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom — the common values of humanity, strive to replace estrangement and clash of civilizations with exchanges and mutual learning, promote understanding and affinity between our peoples, and build ""a garden of civilizations"" featuring mutual appreciation and inspiration. ,The GCC has achieved remarkable progress in its integration process, which makes it one of the world's most dynamic regional organizations. Given their geographical locations, GCC countries serve as a hub linking Asia, Africa and Europe. Endowed with rich energy resources, including 30 percent of the oil reserve and 20 percent of the natural gas reserve of the world, GCC countries are an energy tank for world economy. With their pioneering and enterprising spirit, GCC countries provide a fertile ground for high-tech industries. Over the past four decades and more, the GCC has been working hard to build an integral market, an integral economy, and an integral financial system in the region, and has been playing an increasingly important role in regional and international affairs. ,Over the years, China and GCC countries have maintained healthy and steady growth in bilateral relations, and carried out wide-ranging, in-depth cooperation with tangible outcomes in all areas. In the past 10 years in particular, China-GCC relations have grown from strength to strength and yielded fruitful results. China has remained the GCC's largest trading partner and largest export market of petrochemical products. In 2021, two-way trade exceeded US$230 billion, and China's import of crude oil from GCC countries topped 200 million tons. The two sides enjoy extensive, in-depth cooperation in traditional areas such as production capacity, infrastructure development, investment and finance. Cooperation in high-tech sectors including 5G communications, new energy, space and digital economy is also gaining momentum. The new signature project of smart manufacturing cooperation and the new landscape of industrial cooperation have added fresh impetus to the development of China and GCC countries. ,Looking into the future, China will seize the opportunity of the establishment and consolidation of the China-GCC strategic partnership to cement their traditional friendship and deepen mutual trust. China will continue to firmly support GCC countries in upholding sovereignty, independence, security and stability, and continue to support the GCC in accelerating integration and pursuing diversified development. China will work with the GCC to foster a new pattern of multi-faceted energy cooperation, accelerate new development in financial and investment cooperation, cultivate new highlights in people-to-people exchanges, and explore new areas of innovation cooperation. All this will help increase the convergence of interests between China and GCC countries. ,Saudi Arabia is a major energy exporter in the world and a member of the G20. As its strategic partner and true friend, China is heartened to see that under the leadership of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi people are marching in big strides toward Vision 2030 and making important progress in economic and social reform and diversification. Saudi Arabia's major development initiatives, the Middle East Green Initiative and the Saudi Green Initiative among many others, have captured wide attention. Its stature and influence in global political, economic and energy domains are on the rise. We are proud of our good friend for these accomplishments. ,Since the establishment of diplomatic ties, relations between China and Saudi Arabia have maintained robust growth. Most notably, China-Saudi Arabia cooperation has made major headway in the past 10 years. The two sides respect each other's sovereignty and development path, respect each other's history and cultural traditions, support each other in defending national security and stability, and undertake close strategic coordination. Practical cooperation is expanding rapidly. Major projects have been launched one after another, including the Yanbu Aramco Sinopec Refining Company, the Sino-Saudi Gulei Ethylene Complex Project, the Chinese industrial cluster in Jazan Economic City, the Red Sea utilities and infrastructure project, 5G communications, and joint lunar explorations. People-to-people exchanges continue to grow. Chinese language major is now available in four Saudi universities, and optional Chinese language courses are provided in eight middle and primary schools. Hakim & Kong Xiaoxi, the first animated co-production of China and Saudi Arabia, is popular among children, sowing the seed of China-Saudi Arabia friendship in their hearts. ,China will take this visit as an opportunity to strengthen its comprehensive strategic partnership with Saudi Arabia. We will continue to give each other understanding and support, and jointly advocate independence and oppose external interference. We will further synergize China's Belt and Road Initiative and Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030, deepen and substantiate practical cooperation in all areas, and increase the convergence of interests and people-to-people connectivity between the two countries. We will strengthen collaboration under multilateral frameworks such as the UN, the G20 and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, jointly practice true multilateralism, and make greater contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East and promoting development and prosperity of the world. ,Last October, the Communist Party of China successfully convened its 20th National Congress, and it is now rallying and leading the Chinese people toward the goal of building a modern socialist country in all respects. As a staunch force for world peace and common development, China will stay committed to providing new opportunities for Arab states and all other countries in the world through its own development, and work with our Arab brothers to carry forward the traditional friendship and create a better future together."

            ","“Africa should be a place for international cooperation, not for major-power competition for geopolitical gains,” Chinese ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang talked about U.S. and China’s role in Africa with Semafor’s Editor-at-large Steve Clemons at the Semafor Africa Summit.,Qin pushed back against the false claims that China is creating a “debt trap” in Africa, pointing out that China’s financial assistance to Africa aims to help African countries build infrastructures for economic and social development. “It is transparent, it is sincere,” Qin said.,China has been welcomed by African countries for its stance on non-interference in internal affairs and win-win cooperation. In the recent report entitled “The Biden Administration and Africa in a Changing Global Order: Towards the 2nd US-Africa Summit,” experts from the Institute for Global Dialogue of South Africa provided an African perspective on U.S.-Africa relations, noting “the US engagement largely seeks to counter China and Russia” instead of addressing Africa’s development challenges.,Both China’s Foreign Ministry and Ambassador Qin Gang emphasized the importance of mutual respect, equality, and sincere cooperation in supporting Africa’s development. Africa is an independent continent regarding foreign policy. China firmly opposes using Africa as a geopolitical tool, but China welcomes the international community to help African countries for the continent’s socioeconomic development and the welfare of its people.,Qin Gang pointed out that the U.S. and China should extend cooperation in Africa. As the major countries and permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations, U.S. and China share common responsibilities for the future of the world.

Qin addressed the China-Africa relations Monday with Semafor’s Editor-at-large at the Semafor Africa Summit.,“African countries owe three times more debts to Western private lenders than they owe to China, and their interest rates are double,” Qin said. According to the World Bank and Debt Justice, most of Africa’s debts are owned by non-Chinese multinational institutions.,African countries owe only about one-quarter of their debts to China. Qin said China provides loans to help Africa build infrastructures including highways and hospitals. China is also an active member of G20, suspending the most debt service payment among G20 members.,“Africa should be a place for international cooperation, not for major-power competition for geopolitical gains,” Qin said China’s relationship with Africa is sincere, and China is not interested in the views of other countries on China’s role in Africa.,Ambassador Qin Gang welcomed the international community, including the U.S., to help Africa in efforts for peace, security, and development. He wished the forthcoming Africa-U.S. Summit will come up with more concrete and workable measures."

However, unlike its closely-studied southern part, the evolution of the plateau's northeastern reaches has been less examined.,A group led by Miao Yunfa, a researcher from the Northwest Institute of Eco-environment and Resources under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, evaluated a new sedimentary record from the Qaidam Basin in the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau containing ancient pollen from mountain conifer species that only grow at specific elevational ranges.,They reconstructed two parallel records of landform uplift spanning 16 million years. They found that about 15 million years ago, the eastern and western regions of the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were roughly 1,969 and 1,449 meters above sea level, respectively.,Then, through a rapid uplift over the following several million years, the northeastern reaches grew in height by approximately 2,000 meters – reaching roughly 3,685 meters in the east about 11 million years ago and 3,589 in the west about 7 million years ago, according to the study.,Afterward, those elevations remained largely stable and only rose slightly, according to the study."

With an average elevation of about 4,500 meters, the Sanjiangyuan area sits on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, parts of which span southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region and northwestern Qinghai Province.,Sanjiangyuan is usually seen as an arid and frigid area due to its high altitude. However, the precious water flowing from the abundant glacier resources has nurtured numerous wild flora and fauna, such as snow leopards, Tibetan blue bears and Tibetan foxes.,Known as the ""king of the snowy mountain"", the , generally lives in the bare rocks of the mountain and along the snow line. They are extremely cautious that people can barely locate them. To date, at least 400 snow leopards were identified out of more than 100,000 images taken by infrared cameras in the Sanjiangyuan area. The camera also recorded many scenes of adult snow leopards taking care of cubs.,Tibetan blue bear, or horse bear, is a subspecies of brown bear, which is rarely sighted in the wild. The bear is black with a tinge of blue, and characterized by an iconic white collar around its neck. With the continuous efforts in environmental protection and preservation, the bear population is increasing. More footage of the bear is being captured as well.,In addition to the two mighty and secretive predators, the Tibetan fox is another species that is rarely met. Photos of the species from such a close distance are not often seen. The fox is featured by its big and square face, but quite small, only about the size of a miniature Schnauzer. They,suddenly,become popular internet creatures because of their ""silly"" squint-eyed look.,As a small hunter on the plateau, the Tibetan fox loves pikas and other rodents. They play an important role in controlling rodent pests and maintaining the balance of the plateau ecosystem.,National parks are one of the most important types of protected natural areas in China. They are critical for ecology and biodiversity conservation.,(All images designed by CGTN's Yu Peng)"

            ","Three years into the COVID-19 pandemic, China has , recently to further optimize its response, with its policies on testing, quarantine and travel adjusted.,For example, PCR tests are no longer required when entering most public venues, patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms can now undergo home quarantine, and non-high-risk areas must not impose travel restrictions or suspend businesses.,These changes mark a significant policy shift from the dynamic zero-COVID strategy that China had been sticking to for nearly three years.,So why is China making the changes now? Because after three years' efforts, things are different in the country, according to health authorities and experts.,Firstly, the Omicron sub-variants currently prevalent in China are much milder than previous strains. They are more transmissible but cause less severe illnesses, posing much lower risk to people's health, according to health officials and experts.,China's top respiratory expert , on Friday that 99 percent of the people infected with the latest Omicron sub-variants can fully recover within seven to 10 days, and the death rate from the variants is almost the same as that of flu.,In south China's Guangzhou City, there were more than 160,000 infected cases in the latest wave and no deaths, Tang Xiaoping, head of Guangzhou Medical University, told China Media Group on Monday. Over 90 percent of the infected people showed no symptoms or only mild illness, he added.,Secondly, more than 90 percent of people in China have been fully vaccinated, official date shows. Among them, 86.42 percent of people aged over 60, who are more vulnerable to the virus, had been fully inoculated as of November 28. The government is pushing for more senior residents to get the shot.  ,Why has China waited nearly three years to make the major policy shift, given that many countries chose to live with the virus some time ago?,Actually, China has been making incremental changes to its COVID-19 policies to make them more precise and targeted over the past three years, with the overall situation evaluated. ,The latest policy shift is part of that strategy, according to the health authorities, made possible because the conditions mentioned above are only here now, after China's perseverance over the past three years.,When the virus was detected in Wuhan in late 2019, it was much more deadly. The government made a resolute and courageous decision to shut down traffic in and out of the city. It took China three months to contain the virus in Wuhan and stop it from rippling to other parts of the country.,After that, the country reacted quickly to stamp out over 100 local outbreaks under the dynamic zero COVID principle to safeguard the lives and health of the 1.4 billion people in China.,Meanwhile, the government has been pushing a nationwide vaccination drive to build up immunity protection, which has proved to be effective in preventing deaths and severe cases.,So far, the country has kept its COVID-19 death toll at 5,235 through those relentless efforts.,Yes, the virus has been constantly mutating, from Alpha to Beta to Delta, and now Omicron, with the global death rate going down and down. But that has been a gradual process in the past three years.,Over the same period of time, worldwide, more than 6.62 million people have lost their lives to the pandemic, and the total number of infections has exceeded 642 million, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization.,In the U.S., the world's most developed country with the most abundant medical resources, over 1.09 million people have been killed by the virus and nearly 100 million people have been infected, according to its official data.,Imagine if China, a country with a population over four times that of the U.S. and less sophisticated medical infrastructure, adopted the same anti-COVID policies as the U.S. earlier. That would have put millions of lives at risk.,As a matter of fact, China has the lowest COVID incidence rate and the lowest number of COVID deaths among major countries.,According to Zhong, as of November 28, 2022, the COVID incidence rate in China was 1/374 of the global average and 1/1348 of that in the U.S., and the death rate in China was 1/232 of the global average.,People's life expectancy rose from 77.4 in 2019 to 77.93 in 2020 and 78.2 in 2021, official data showed.,That result was achieved because the Chinese government made people's life and health its top priority when making its COVID policies., "

Go! The Giant Panda National Park,"

    11:52, 11-Dec-2022

            ","The Giant Panda National Park is located in the western region of China, spanning Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. It is one of the first batch of national parks in China to be established with a single species as the core and integrated in its main habitat. At the same time, it is a protected ecological home where there are more than 8,000 species of flora and fauna, and more than 1,600 species of rare animals from the same region.,Giant pandas are a national treasure of China and have been around for 8 or 9 million years. They like to live alone in places with lots of bamboo at an altitude of about 3,000 meters. They usually have the desire to mate in April or May, and only one young panda can be born at a time, so giant pandas are very precious. Pandas are born with a snowy white body and can have black and white fur only after about three weeks. Panda cubs are very small, about the size of a person's hand, and do not survive easily, which is why pandas are relatively rare.,In addition to giant pandas, there are also red pandas in the park. They look like cats, but are heavier and reddish-brown in color. They live in large tree caves or rock crevices. They come out to feed in the morning and evening, and mostly sleep in the shade of large trees during the day. The leaves of bamboo are the main source of food for red pandas, but they also eat berries, flowers, bird eggs and other plants.,The Chinese Monal is also a permanent resident in the park, and they are often found in groups. The males have 10 different colors of plumage and are as brilliant as a rainbow as they move through the forest. They are alert and will run away at the first sign of danger, thanks to their strong legs and hover from low to high in flight with the upward lift of air currents, which is rare in other species.,The establishment of Giant Panda National Park has connected 73 scattered isolated nature reserves and 13 individual giant panda populations in the past, which means that the isolation barrier has been removed and giant pandas can visit their friends, which is of great significance to the reproduction of giant pandas and the conservation of other animals."

Human Carbon Footprint: Efficiency dilemma of solar power,"

    12:54, 11-Dec-2022

            ","In one hour, the Earth's atmosphere receives enough sunlight to power the electricity needs of every human being for a year. But because the Earth is so vast, that translates to about only 1,000 watts of energy per square meter of surface. ,Given the 20-percent efficiency of a solar panel, that means you put a one-square-meter panel under the sun and wait for about five hours. Then you can get one kilowatt hour. That's one unit of electricity on your bill. ,In comparison, a power plant can finish this job by burning just 300 grams of coal. For now, we have to rely on such inefficient ways to obtain such diluted energy. To compensate, we have to go big. Very big. ,When over 600 square kilometers of desert are covered with solar panels, it's a different story. Based in Talatan, Qinghai Province, China, Hainan Solar Park is one of the world's largest solar farms. But it's just a fraction of a more ambitious plan in Qinghai, which includes 2,000 square kilometers with an installed capacity of 154 million kilowatts, equivalent to seven Three Gorges power stations.,In fact, according to data from China's National Energy Administration, China has 323 gigawatts of solar capacity, around a third of the entire global total. More importantly, mass production and research progress here have cut the panel price by 75 percent in 10 years. But that doesn't mean we can solve the climate crisis by covering an entire desert. Engineering and economics aside, a massive solar farm will absorb more heat than the natural sand, change the region's climate, and dramatically transform the ecological landscape. ,The good news is we have a lot of desert and unused land around the world. But the bad news is few people live there. So we need to invest more in grids to transfer the energy to people who need it. How can we bring renewable energy closer to us?,Today solar panels can be found anywhere in China. Rooftops are just old-fashioned. If people want to avoid the worst of climate change, we need to be more creative about where we put solar panels. ,For example, fishermen like Liu Jianhua raised creative fish-pond-host solar farms in Changzhou, east China's Jiangsu Province. Solar power panels above ponds have little effect on the seafood. And selling electricity can make money. ,So it's a win-win for fishermen. Compared to a massive solar farm in the remote desert, this distributed system near people is a new trend. At present, floating photovoltaics like this have entered a period of rapid development globally. ,Due to good support policies and mature business models, the total installed capacity of Chinese floating photovoltaic projects has reached the first place in the world, mainly distributed in coastal and riverside cities."

            ","In east China's Suzhou, there is a new type of Ultra High Voltage (UHV) called UHV AC, which connects it with surrounding cities including Nantong, Nanjing, Hefei, Hangzhou and Shanghai. They form one of the world's most important city groups and manufacturing hubs. UHA helps to build a giant energy loop among them and reduce the number of local power plants.,The difference between the long-distance power transmission UHV Direct Current and UHV Alternative Current is the quantity of landing points. UHV DC only has one starting point and one landing point, while in the case of UHV AC, there can be a landing point in the middle of the power line at any time. So, cities along the AC line starting from Suzhou can get the electricity directly.,In this case, since all cities are along a section of the Yangtze River, a 1000-kilovolt AC line needs to cross the river to complete a UHV loop.,But how to transmit AC line along the Yangtze River? Because there is the relatively busy section of the Yangtze River, the way adopted by engineer Wang Zhongqiu and his team from State Grid GIL project is building a tunnel under the river. ,The total length of the tunnel is 5468.5 meters with an expansion joint every few hundred meters. The tunnel has 503 expansion joints in the entire pipe gallery. ,According to Wang, the main function of the expansion joint is to absorb some thermal expansion and contraction, including the settlement of the tunnel, and it also absorbs some of the forces. Inside the insulated pipeline filled with dielectric gas, energy flows safely through the Yangtze River.,Eastern China has been the load center in China for many years. Without electricity from outside the area, this area needs a lot of local coal-fired power plants. ,After using clean energy like UHV, people can reduce the number of local power plants and save a lot of energy."

If the mission is a success, it will be the first spacecraft funded and built by a private firm to land on the moon.,China's lunar exploration program was approved in 2004. It has finished its three-step lunar exploration program of orbiting, landing and return when the Chang'e-5 lunar probe brought back 1,731g of samples from the moon in December 17, 2020.,This is not an end to the country's lunar exploration. The country has started the fourth phase of lunar exploration program, including the Chang'e-6, Chang'e-7, and Chang'e-8.,Among them, Chang'e-6 is set to collect samples from the far side of the moon and bring them back to Earth, Wu Weiren, chief designer of China's lunar exploration program and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said in an interview on November 24.,The Chang'e-7 mission is going to land on the moon's South Pole and have a flyover to search for water in the caves at the moon's South Pole that never sees sunlight, according to the chief designer.,Chang'e-8, which will be launched around 2028, will form the basis of a scientific research station at the moon's South Pole with Chang'e-7, said Wu, adding that the station will include a lunar orbiter, lander, rover, a flying vehicle and multiple scientific instruments.,China has long called for cooperation, rather than a space race. The country calls on all countries to carry out in-depth exchanges and cooperation in outer space on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, peaceful utilization, and inclusive development.,According to Wu, China is studying the feasibility of building internet communications on the moon to integrate data relay, navigation, and remote sensing, which is expected to achieve effective management of the lunar probes.,(With input from agencies)"

""Chenxi's skills are well-rounded. His spirit moves the whole team."" The coach's face remains calm and strict.,As Chenxi progresses in his craft, he moves from No. 7 to No. 10, a more essential role in the team. ""Soccer is not just a one-player game, it requires team effort."" Chenxi bears in mind his coach's words.,Thinking about the future, Chenxi's father is rather modest. ""I just want him to be happy. I'm not thinking about how big his achievements should be. I just hope his future can represent how hard he works today."",But Chenxi's online fans are far more hopeful. Many of them think that Chenxi is destined to be a part of China's future golden generation of soccer.,For the young talent himself, he is ""the happiest when he plays soccer.""

Human Carbon Footprint: Storing renewable energy,"

            ","Besides pumped-storage hydropower, which accounts for over 90 percent of total global electricity storage, new ways of storing renewable energy are emerging in China.,In pumped-storage hydropower, electricity is used to pump water to the dams, where it is stored as potential energy. When needed, the water is released to drive turbines to produce electricity. The largest facility of its kind is Fengning Power Station in north China's Hebei Province. This year, it proved its ability by helping the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics run 100 percent on renewable energy.,Catching up are batteries – the most scalable type of grid-scale storage. As the world's top electric vehicle (EV) battery maker, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Ltd. (CATL) has supplied over 30 percent of global EV batteries. Now, its products have a new place to go, the solar and wind farms, to hook up new energy with the grid. But for now, this method is not cost-effective because lithium-ion batteries have a relatively low energy density.,The good news is that thinner foil is being produced to increase energy density by allowing more electrode material to be packed in the same size battery cell. According to CALT senior manager Liu Yuqing, the thinnest anode that they can produce is 4.5 micron, ranking the top level in the industry.,However, in the eyes of Lu Wengang, the director of China's TELD New Energy, the future of grid storage has already been produced. ,In Lu's opinion, when an EV is taken only as a means of transportation, cruising range of a 50 kilowatt-hour battery is up to 180,000 kilometers during its 10-year use period. It will only consume 30,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, with 170,000 kilowatt-hours power storage capacity left.,Everyday, after his colleagues drive their EVs to the company, Lu turns on the system which can take over the batteries of their 300 EVs. Cars will instantly become storage for 2 megawatts of solar panels, powering the entire factory. With those EVs and solar panels, his factory will become a micro grid, which is a part of the city grid, participating in a more complex interaction. Energy flows through the cars, and when the shift is over, people drive home in charged EVs. ,By 2040, China could have 300 million EVs, with a combined battery of 20-billion kilowatt hour capacity, equal to the electricity consumed in China for a day.,All the above-mentioned new ways of storing renewable energy are changing the way humans use energy. With huge potential, maybe someday they could drive the new energy revolution."

CGTN sat down with him, talking about the differences between stage and film, and how life experience has shaped his work.,There are different dynamics between stage and film.,Doyle is a cinematographer, director and actor. When talking about the similarities and differences between film and stage, he said it's the ""space."",""In theater, performance has to be projected, then you need to have the intimacy on stage so there's a very different dynamic going on for the actors whereas in cinema it's really much me and the actor. So I always say there are only three people in cinema, it's you the actor, me the cinematographer and the audience, and my job is to share to get that. There’s different energy and way of sharing between stage and film."",""I'm the most privileged person in Chinese cinema."",Doyle left Australia at the age of 18 and arrived in Hong Kong at the age of 28. He is a nourisher of both Western and Eastern cultures.,""I grew up in the 1960s which was a special time in Western history, That's a great privilege in a certain way that I had crazy experiences. I traveled the world as a merchant marine and did other things. For those experiences, I went through them young enough that influenced me in some way that actually later in life has become extremely important."",""But I think what I'm doing now, I think everyone would agree they can't get rid of me. I'm part of the Chinese film or culture or art or whatever word you call. I am part of it, but I'm not Chinese. Actually, I'm not Christopher Doyle, I'm Du Kefeng 杜可风. I have this incredible freedom that most people, any artists need to have. I'm the most privileged person in Chinese cinema because I'm free, I don't use it as a tool, but I take refuge in it."",Doyle said If people don't work hard, people won't get there. Talent is nothing without work.,""Looked at my own work, it was only about eight years after and a number of films later that I really felt comfortable about what I'm doing. And that was when we did 'Days of Being Wild.' Before that, I think I was still fumbling around, sometimes you find fantastic stuff, sometimes it was a total mess. And then I realized suddenly something opened, some light went on and from then on it became quite different and much easier. But it took a certain amount of time. People ask me all the time. What's your best film? I'm not being facetious or being cute. I say the next one, it has to be the next one, you have to do better.”,Doyle is now working on a documentary ""Your Secret  Love For My Peach Blossom Land""with director Hei Wen.,""It's the 30 years of 'Secret Love and Peach Blossom Land.' So we're getting as many people as possible who have acted the play in different parts of China at different times in the last 30 years. So we're putting them together and seeing what happens, see what sort of new form will come out of this."",Doyle speaks on advice for youth with dreams in film and the cinema industry: ""You want to do it or even if you think you want to do it, don't do it. If you need to, do it."""

China unveils first batch of images taken by solar probe ASO-S,"

    14:19, 13-Dec-2022

            ","China on Tuesday released the first batch of images captured by the country's first multipurpose solar probe at a press conference at the National Space Science Center in Beijing.,The Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory (ASO-S), dubbed Kuafu-1, has been operating in orbit 720 kilometers from the Earth, facing the sun since its ,. ,The images were captured by three different payloads on the probe in the last two months – Full-disk MagnetoGraph (FMG), Lyman-alpha Solar Telescope (LST) and Hard X-ray Imager (HXI).,HXI achieved hard X-ray imaging of the solar flares, the only imager in the world to capture solar hard X-rays from the angle of the Earth. ,Solar flares are sudden outbursts of particles from the sun's surface. Radiation from these bursts is emitted across a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum that are characterized by different wavelengths. Hard X-rays are short wavelengths and has high photon energies. ,The FMG observed the sun's magnetic field – the first time for China to make such observations from space. ,The LST, comprising three pieces of equipment, obtained the first full-disk solar-image in Lyman-alpha line, in which solar prominence was clearly seen, and observed two rare white-light flares. ,The sun emits light in all colors, but our eyes usually perceive it as yellow as the color has the brightest wavelength from the sun. Specialized instruments can observe light far beyond the ranges visible to the naked eye and collect data for scientists to study solar events that may bring potential harm to human activities.,NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory, or SDO, also has three instruments. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), measured in angstroms (Å), images 10 different wavelengths. Its Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument focuses on the movement and magnetic properties of the sun's surface and provides three additional images.,China's ASO-S will provide more insight of the sun with data collected over the its four-year minimum life span. It is designed to accumulate and transmit back some 500 gigabytes of data each day. That is, tens of thousands of high-quality images.,During the ASO-S' time in space, it will cover the 2024 to 2025 peak of the solar cycle, a best window period for studying the sun, according to Gan Weiqun, the satellite's principal scientist from the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) under CAS.,Gan said that it's the world's first near-Earth satellite telescope to simultaneously monitor solar flares, coronal mass ejections and the sun's magnetic field.,""The satellite is still in the in-orbit test phase, and it is testing the observation capability of the payloads,"" said Gan.,The institute confirmed that the data and images collected by ASO-S will be opened to free access after the probe's initial commissioning phase. ,Three ground stations in the cities of Sanya, Kashgar and Beijing, far apart from each other, are in charge of receiving data from ASO-S, before sending them in packages to a 2,048-core powerful computer mounted at the PMO for decoding.,The construction of the data base will be finished before next April, according to Gan.,(CGTN's Liu Wei, Zhao Chenchen and Zheng Yibing contributed to the story.)"

FIBA secretary general calls China's women's team 'most promising',"

            ","Andreas Zagklis, secretary general of FIBA, the international basketball governing body, described the Chinese women's national team as the most promising team at the press conference on Monday.,China reached the final in the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup in Australia in October and finished the tournament as the runners-up. It was the second time the team did so in the history of the World Cup (World Championship). The last time was in 1994, also in Australia.,Zagklis recalled that Yao Ming, president of the Chinese Basketball Association, had told him before the World Cup that the Chinese national team would go all the way to the final stage. Zagklis praised Chinese players including Han Xu and Li Meng, saying that he saw confidence in them and the belief that they could beat any opponent once they were on the court.,The FIBA executive also spoke highly of the various club competitions of women's basketball in Asia, including China's WCBA. He believes that FIBA will join hands with all associations to promote the development of women's basketball.,Part of the women's basketball games in the Paris Olympics in 2024 will move to Lille, which is about 200 kilometers north of Paris. Zagklis told reporters that FIBA can compromise over the relocation of the venue, but they won't compromise over safety of the athletes. He understands that the Paris Organizing Committee for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games wants to have the women's basketball games in a bigger arena, but FIBA needs a working solution, which may cost a lot of money.,The women's basketball competitions in Lille will happen at Stade Pierre-Mauroy, which has a capacity to hold 27,000 people. It hosted some of the games at EuroBasket 2015 and other major competitions."
China's GCC and Arab outreach: Adding a new chapter to ancient relations,"

    11:17, 13-Dec-2022

            ","International diplomacy is a dynamic process. Institutional frameworks and established protocols exist to guide our leaders, while the longevity of our multilateral relations provide the foundations for negotiation. Still, above all, we cannot underestimate the power of personal rapport – the importance of being able to meet face-to-face to discuss the most pressing global issues of our times, at the very highest levels.,The last three years have brought us many challenges. As the international community begins to emerge from the shadows of a global pandemic, as a diplomat, I take reassurance from the fact that high-profile diplomatic events have seen a revival in recent months. From the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) Summit in Uzbekistan and the 27th session of the Conference of Parties (COP27) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, to the G20 meeting in Indonesia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Cambodia, we have gradually witnessed the rhythm of in-person diplomacy kicking back into action, at a time when international cooperation is more important than ever. This cooperative spirit is the expectation with which we as Emiratis will welcome the world for COP28 in Dubai next year.,As the Middle East re-establishes itself as a meeting place of civilizations, another landmark occasion has recently taken place. Last week, we saw Chinese President Xi Jinping arrive in Riyadh with a state visit that was marked by two seminal events: the inaugural China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and China-Arab summits. We commend our partners in Saudi Arabia for bringing our leaders together in such a comprehensive way for the very first time.,One of my most memorable moments as a diplomat came earlier this year, when I had the honor of accompanying the President of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, to the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing. It is a true testament to the strength of our bilateral relationship that, at the height of a global pandemic, H.H. Sheikh Mohamed personally made the trip to China and was warmly welcomed by President Xi.,Nonetheless, for many of our partners in the Gulf region and wider Middle East, last week's summits have really been the first opportunity for Arab leaders to meet their Chinese counterparts since the pandemic began. Cooperation agreements were signed, investment deals were struck, and international security issues were discussed. The summits should rightly be heralded as signature triumphs in international diplomacy and multilateral cooperation.,The GCC is certainly no monolith – its member countries have their own unique cultures, societies and interests. This is even more the case with the wider Arab world – a vibrant and diverse network of countries spanning the whole length of the Middle East and North Africa region. Yet together we represent an entire civilization, bound to one another by history and tradition. It is these foundations that define the kindred spirit that Arab peoples share with the people of China: Our civilizations are ancient, our histories are rich and our traditions have shaped the modern world. ,Last week's summits represent a new and auspicious chapter in the brotherly relationships between China and the Arab world. Our future is bright and full of promise, yet we should not forget that our peoples have relied on each other for centuries. China's cooperation with the Arab world goes all the way back to the seventh century, to the age of empires, when the world saw a flourishing of new trade networks arise across the Eurasian continent. This era was defined as much by commerce as it was by an expansion of collaboration in science – an intercultural exchange of knowledge, in medicine, mathematics, and astronomy.,Fast forward to the present day, in which China and my own country, the UAE, are modern, enterprising nations at the very forefront of cutting-edge ingenuity and innovation. In the 38 years since the UAE and China first established diplomatic ties, our two countries have nurtured our mutual relationship to ever-ascending heights. China has become our most important trading partner, while the UAE serves as China's most vital logistics and financial hub in the region. Especially since the signing of our Comprehensive Strategic Partnership four years ago, China and the UAE have expanded their cooperation across many areas, including sustainable development, artificial intelligence and food security. Both our countries are committed to pushing the boundaries of science and technology for the betterment of mankind.,Centuries ago, our Arab ancestors developed the maritime ""Spice Routes,"" bringing extensive avenues of commerce to complement China's iconic ""Silk Road."" Today, the collaborative spirit of these networks lives on, through China's visionary Belt and Road Initiative. Through this initiative, the multifaceted collaboration between China and the Arab world has been rejuvenated; it has entered a new paradigm. The UAE, for our part, plays a pivotal role in this network, connecting China with the wider Middle East and North Africa.,Speaking at the China-GCC summit, President Xi Jinping remarked on the historical bonds between our peoples: ""Both belonging to the family of Eastern civilizations, China and GCC countries have similar culture and values. And the peoples enjoy close bonds of friendship."" He mentioned how the two sides are natural partners for cooperation, and have consistently maintained solidarity in times of adversity.,In China and across the Arab world, our leaders are committed to building a prosperous and fulfilling future, not just for their own people, but for mankind more broadly. This is something that can only be achieved through sincere and earnest cooperation at the international level. The UAE is always open to this sort of cooperation, and we will continue to work with our friends in China, the Arab world, as well as other like-minded countries, to achieve the same visionary goals that President Xi himself has expressed – to promote a global community with a shared future and joint prosperity for all."
Xi's Saudi visit prompts optimism on future of China-Arab relations,"

    08:35, 10-Dec-2022

            ","Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Saudi Arabia, which included the high-powered China-Arab Summit and China-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Summit besides the bilateral summit with the Saudi leadership, is being seen as an ""epoch-making milestone in the history of China-Arab relations"" by both sides.,Speaking to CGTN, a prominent Saudi political analyst and media commentator expressed optimism on the future of the Chinese-Arab relationship, hoping that President Xi's Saudi visit and his meetings with the Arab leadership will take the ties to a new level which will not only be beneficial for China and the Arab nations but also contribute to humanity and the global economy.,""All three summits are very important and crucial and came at a time when the world is going through massive changes and challenges,"" said Salman Al-Ansari, speaking via Zoom from Riyadh. To elucidate on how momentous Xi's visit and the three summits are regarded, he cited another noted Saudi academic Mohammed Al Sultan who has described the events as the ""Summit of all Summits."",Following a spectacular and grand welcome reception on Thursday at Al Yamamah Palace in the capital Riyadh, Xi held bilateral talks with Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.,Describing the meeting as one between the Asian and the Arab giants, Al-Ansari stressed that China and Saudi Arabia have the potential and capabilities to change, develop and enhance the global economic map to serve the peoples of the two nations and the entire world. He also said that the Saudi-Chinese bilateral summit was focused on three aspects – strategic partnership, transfer of knowledge and technology, and strengthening partnership in the field of energy.,""The Kingdom is the world's largest energy exporter and China is the world's largest energy importer. And the relationship between the two countries is tremendously important to the global economy,"" he noted.,Al-Ansari revealed that over 20 preliminary agreements worth more than 110 billion Saudi riyals, or close to $30 billion, were signed on the sidelines of the Saudi-Chinese summit. An integration plan between Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 and China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was also agreed upon. He noted that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has launched an award for cultural cooperation between the two countries. The deals and initiatives flow from the comprehensive strategic partnership that the two sides established in 2016.,""With the integration of BRI and Vision 2030, the two sides can build up a supply chain that can connect continents,"" said Al-Ansari highlighting Saudi Arabia's strategic advantage due to its location in a region that connects Asia, Africa and Europe. ""As we all know, Riyadh is the gateway to the Middle East and the gateway to the Arab and Muslim world. And China acknowledges the importance of Riyadh, regionally and globally."",Al-Ansari also said that China and the Arab world have mutual admiration for each other. ""Definitely China is today a superpower that we look up to and we admire, and we have a lot in common,"" he said while extending congratulations to the Chinese nation and people for the historical successes achieved in recent years. ""This would not have been possible without the vision and wisdom of the wise leadership of President Xi Jinping,"" he added.,China has historic and friendly ties with the Arab world. The exchanges between China and Arab states date back more than 2,000 years. In a signed article published Thursday in the Saudi newspaper Al Riyadh, President Xi underlined that ""China will work with Arab states to carry forward the traditional friendship and jointly build a China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era."",Al-Ansari said the vision has been welcomed by the Arab countries and people, who relate with the historic civilizational linkages with China. ""The Chinese and the Arabs represent two of the most important human civilizations,"" he said.,""There are many commonalities between the Chinese and the Arab societies, both of which are collectivistic societies that value the concept of family and respect for the elders. And both societies, the Arab and the Chinese, are well-established with an ancient history and great human civilizations,"" he added.,Al-Ansari also cited an anecdote on how the Arabs contributed to spreading the Chinese invention of paper to the West. Paper was invented in China around the first century.,It is well documented how the Arab merchants traveling through the Silk Road learned the art of making paper from the Chinese and built the first paper industry in Baghdad in 793 CE. Subsequently, the Arab traders brought the knowledge of papermaking to the West in the 8th century.,""Science, knowledge and libraries spread throughout the world due to the Chinese-Arab cooperation,"" remarked the Saudi analyst. With a philosophical note, Al-Ansari saw the current summits in Riyadh as ""a continuation of what our ancestors started centuries ago by serving humanity through cooperation in all fields."", "

Young Chinese artist releases energy through art,"

            ","Zhang Zipiao, a 29-year-old rising star in China's art world, recently held a museum-level solo exhibition titled ""Moonquake"" at Long Museum, Shanghai. ,The young artist builds delicate visions with intuitive strokes and abstract pictures full of animal and plant anatomical structures, with each color nourishing a kind of emotion, or corresponding to a certain sound and warmth. Her interweaving images create a space where one can place oneself in the universe and also see a universe within.,An artist who looks like a pixie making large-scale paintings – Zhang appears to be a mosaic of contrasts. But where does that energy come from?,""I think this kind of energy should be innate. Since I was a child, I liked running and jumping around outdoors. Perhaps others say that I've got too much energy. For instance, many of my paintings are large-sized, but I think it fits my personality. I just can't hold back in doing anything. I prefer to do things freely. And I run after painting. I have to exhaust all my energy, or I can't sleep at night,"" said Zhang.,Zhang was drawn to art long before college. Perhaps there was a nature element – her father taught animation at Tsinghua University, and also a nurture element – her physician mother used to show her lots of x-ray photos.,All this, and a great influence from some iconic artists, set her on the path to becoming a professional painter after graduating from the Chicago Academy of Art in 2015.,Zhang admires talented artists who focus on themselves, such as Francis Bacon and Louise Bourgeois. ""They explore human nature and complexities from their own life experiences. You can feel that they create art with their souls. Very genuine,"" said Zhang.,Noting the notion of uniqueness of individuals, Zhang also stressed the social responsibility of artists.,""To a certain extent, artists actually have the social responsibility to voice their views in the language of art. In the past, perhaps because I was still young and I had never experienced such a big social event (COVID-19) before, I was above pretending that my art was exploring something deeper. But it's different now. I'm pretty sensitive about what's happening in the world. So, I'm sure I'll have a great idea about my creations,"" explained Zhang.,As for the status quo in China's art world, Zhang said it's good to see that more professional art agents, organizations and collectors have emerged in the country since she returned from the U.S. in 2016.,And China has also paid more attention to the development of young artists in recent years. When it comes to the recognition she's received, Zhang remained quite measured, saying it's such a privilege for young artists to have more opportunities to show their works, but definitely not to show off.,""Really, I don't think I deserve it. I don't think I deserve so much attention. In fact, as a young artist, you should not get too much when you are young, and it's too early to belong to a high-profile franchise. Instead, you should work hard in a place where no one can reach you. That's accumulation and achievement. So, when I paint, I need to spend significant time alone accumulating that kind of energy,"" said Zhang.,Actions are more important than words. Through her career, Zhang has never stopped recharging herself.,Humble and positive, the artist said when art ""finds"" her, she gains another angle to rediscover herself and everything around her.,""As a matter of fact, human beings have a lot in common with mountains and rivers. I mean those lines, trends, colors, and the sense of flow are actually very similar. I realized that that's very interesting. All roads lead to Rome,"" said Zhang."

It can sometimes be tricky to balance my time and my way is to divide my time for each part,"" Yu said.,Yu's work wasn't selected for the competition the previous year, so for the entire year, he quietly worked on the next competition.,""When the email was sent to me, it read 'Dear contestants,' I thought I'd missed out again and didn't open it fully. Later I did and saw I'd been shortlisted, I was so excited. I secretly cried a few times. It has been especially hard during the past few years because of the small number of performance venues and few actors, my actors for this play have changed three times,"" Yu said.,The competition is open to Chinese applicants aged 35 and under, or those presenting their theatrical skills for the first time.,Yu is 34 years old and has occasionally had his decision to continue pursuing his love of theater questioned. For example, ""as a 34-year-old, do you feel that you are not focused enough on your main job? Do you think the theater's path, which makes little money, is the right one? ,The work Yu brought is called ""Stretch,"" which reflects everyday struggles in people's life. It talks about forces holding back people, which people want to escape, but it is always within range.,After four rounds of competition in ten days, their efforts paid off. Yu's team was one of the top six, and they also received high recognition and support from the audience.,""Many from the audience came to me and asked us when we will perform. I'm happy to see they recognize and like us. My psychological state has changed, I am more determined about what play I want to do in the future, this is my biggest gain,"" Yu described.,The path to success is long and sometimes fraught with difficulties. But it also gives life to stories, and Yu's story is one, that continues to grow and inspire."
Joint efforts between China and ROK can lead to prosperity and peace,"

    14:20, 14-Dec-2022

            ","While addressing the third China-ROK Entrepreneurs and Former High-Level Official Dialogues via video, on December 12, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called on both China and South Korea to work towards maintaining the smooth flow of industrial supply chains and safeguarding the international free trade system. Besides, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in his exchange with his counterpart Park Jin also spoke about how both countries should play a constructive role to diffuse nuclear tensions on the Korean peninsula. Meaningful cooperation between the two countries, stronger trading ties for joint prosperity and resolution of security quagmires for a more promising future can materialize.,Friendship, cordiality and leveraging complementary strengths is the key to address common challenges faced by the two countries. With this year marking the 30th anniversary of diplomatic relations, China and South Korea can take their existing platforms to new levels. This includes the completion of the second phase of the China-South Korea Free Trade Agreement (CSKFTA) of 2014 which covers 17 areas of goods trade, government procurements, preservation of the environment, competition policies and e-commerce. Both sides made a commitment after the signing of the agreement that they will continue to carry out service trade negotiations as follow ups. CSKFTA also allows for 91 percent of South Korea exports to China being subject to tariff elimination in 20 years which amounts to $141.7 billion. Secondly in terms of market openness, both sides will provide reciprocal treatment to each other's financial companies entering their own capital markets. A prime example is how Korean construction companies in the Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone can contract cooperative projects in China in the absence of restrictions concerning proportional investments.,The completion of the second phase of CSKFTA can complement the positive trading trends between the two countries. In the first seven months of 2022, bilateral trade had risen to 8.9 percent and amounted to $214.9 billion, accounting for 5.9 percent of China's total foreign trade. As per a Korean Peninsula expert from the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences Lu Chao, such figures indicate growth momentum in the existing complementarity between the two countries involving supply and production chains, especially in high technology and chemical industry. Leveraging complementarity for win-win cooperation is precisely what Premier Li alluded to at the third ROK Entrepreneurs and Former High-level Officials Dialogue where there's deepening cooperation in the fields of high-tech manufacturing, big data and the green economy. Friendly, neighborly relations provide a context through which the rights of foreign investors, encouragement of fair competition between all enterprises and fostering market-based environments can materialize.,To capitalize on these positive trends, it is critical that threats to the global multilateral trading order have to be addressed. During talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Park Jin, Foreign Minister Wang Yi mentioned how measures adopted by the U.S. President Joe Biden's administration such as the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the U.S. rejection of the WTO's decision regarding former U.S. president Donald Trump era steel tariffs violated international rules and regulations. Such unilateral approaches only harm impartial trading between countries in the Asia Pacific and beyond, which promote joint prosperity.,To safeguard the international free trade system and ensure the smooth progression of supply chains, it is crucial that sustainable peace and long-term stability in the Korean peninsula materializes. Given their geographical proximity and historical influence, both China and South Korea are in an excellent position to resolve instability through dialogue and diplomacy. Foreign Minister Park Jin sought China's support for Seoul's initiative on providing economic assistance to Democratic People's Republic of Korea in exchange for denuclearization steps and initiating dialogue between the two countries. Such solution-oriented proposals need to be articulated between respective leaderships on both sides to ensure that zero-sum approaches are replaced with win-win cooperation.,For far too long security dynamics in the Asia Pacific have been defined by Cold War binaries perpetuated by the United States that include attempts to bifurcate the region into ""pro-China"" and ""anti-China"" camps. Such strategies alongside military build ups aimed at promoting separatism in China's Taiwan region threaten to upend the status quo and have led to greater misunderstandings between regional countries. The respective leaderships of both China and South Korea should ensure that trust deficits do not widen and joint understandings prevail on matters relating to peace, security and stability in the Asia Pacific.,The messages articulated during delegation level talks between China and South Korea including Premier Li Keqiang's calls at the third China-ROK Entrepreneurs and Former High-Level Officials Dialogue provides a road map for both countries to take their strategic cooperation to new heights and build on the spirit of the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties."

How China strengthens vaccine cooperation to battle COVID-19,"

    19:22, 14-Dec-2022

            ","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the world has raced against time, battling the pandemic as it wreaked havoc across the globe. Developing safe and effective vaccines is one of the most crucial steps in the fight against the virus.,For the last nearly three years, China has made strides in its COVID-19 vaccine research and taken concrete steps toward fulfilling its commitment to making the vaccines a global public good.,In January 2020, Chinese researchers quickly revealed the full genome sequence of the virus after the first epidemic outbreak at the end of 2019.  The decision to make the data public was praised by global scientists.,Jeremy Farrar, a medical researcher and director at Wellcome Trust, a London-based charitable foundation on health research, described it as a ""potentially really important moment in global public health-must be celebrated"" in a tweet.,In March 2020, the adenovirus vector vaccine developed by a team led by Chinese military medical scientist Chen Wei became the first vaccine in China approved to enter clinical trials.,After the first phase of trials was completed, the second phase of trials started in April. At that time, China's COVID-19 vaccine was the first in the world to enter the second phase of clinical trials, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).,Other COVID-19 vaccine research had been carried out concurrently, including the inactivated vaccine developed by the China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) and the inactive one from Beijing-based pharmaceutical company Sinovac.,As the virus keeps mutating, China has continued to advance its vaccine research over the past three years. As of October 2022, at least 46 COVID-19 vaccines were being tested in human trials domestically and over 20 in overseas clinical trials.,Among them, three inactivated monovalent vaccines for Omicron variants were being tested for sequential immunization on the Chinese mainland, in Hong Kong and in the United Arab Emirates.,China's vaccines have played a crucial role in the global response to the pandemic, offering countries more choices amid the vaccine divide across the globe.,In May 2021, the WHO listed the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. It was the first Chinese vaccine officially recognized by the WHO and the sixth vaccine approved for emergency use globally.,The WHO included the vaccine on the emergency use list for its ""safety, efficacy and quality,"" said the WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, at a press briefing.,In the following month, another inactive vaccine produced by Sinovac got approval from the WHO for emergency use.,Compared with other vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer during that time, the inactive vaccine from China had an advantage: It can be stored and transported in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius. It is particularly suitable for developing countries with inadequate vaccine storage and transportation facilities to store large amounts of vaccines at low temperatures.,In May 2022, the CONVIDECIA COVID-19 vaccine developed by Chinese developer CanSino Biologics was given the green light by the WHO for emergency use. It was the third Chinese vaccine after Sinopharm and Sinopec certified by WHO Emergency Use Listing.,""The world desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe,"" said Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant director-general for access to health products, in a news release in June 2021.,She also urged manufacturers to participate in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) scheme, a worldwide initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for rich and poor countries alike to bring the pandemic under control.,Since China joined COVAX in October 2020, it has continuously offered vaccine aid to less developed countries. In August 2021, China pledged to provide 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to the world throughout 2021 and offered $100 million to COVAX.,""We welcome this contribution from China, which will enable further access to COVID-19 vaccines for the most at risk in low- and middle-income countries,"" said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.,Other measures include $ 2 billion in international aid from China to help developing countries respond to the impact of COVID-19 and building a cooperation mechanism for Chinese hospitals to pair up with 30 African hospitals.,As of May 2022, China had provided anti-epidemic materials to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, including 2.2 billion doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The country also sent medical expert groups to 34 countries and shared its experience in epidemic response with more than 180 countries and international organizations.,Since the onset of the pandemic, China has regarded protecting people and their lives as a top priority, no matter whether they are at home or abroad.,As of December 7, 2022, approximately 3.45 billion vaccine jabs had been administered nationwide. Over 228 million people over 60 received full vaccination, accounting for 86 percent of the total population in that age group.,Overseas Chinese nationals were also offered COVID-19 vaccines. Within three months after China rolled out the ""Spring Sprout"" vaccine program in March 2021, more than 1.18 million overseas Chinese in over 150 countries had been inoculated with Chinese or foreign vaccines.,The Chinese government extended the coverage of the inoculation program to foreign citizens living in China by giving Chinese vaccines to foreign nationals of eligible age and providing timely treatment to those infected with COVID-19. The country also adjusted the prevention and control measures for foreign nationals entering China."

Negotiation of the framework began in 2019 and the first official draft was released on July 12, 2021. According to the first draft by the UN Environment Programme, the Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework builds on the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, aiming to implement broad-based action to bring about a transformation in society's relationship with biodiversity. ,At the opening ceremony of the COP15, Huang Runqiu, president of COP15 and China's minister of ecology and environment mentioned that ""China will continue to exert its leadership in promoting substantial results in negotiations on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework."",As one of the world's most bio-diverse countries, China's land and maritime territories are both vast. Its complex topography and diverse climate gave birth to unique ecosystems, abundant species and rich genetic variety. ,According to the white paper on Biodiversity Conservation in China published by the State Council Information Office in 2021, the habitats for wild animals have been expanding and their populations are growing. For instance, the population of giant pandas in the wild has grown from 1,114 to 1,864 over the past 40 years, and the crested ibis population has increased from only 7 to over 5,000. China has also established nearly 10,000 protected areas of all types and at all levels, accounting for about 18 percent of the total land area. ,A series of ecological protection and restoration projects were carried out in China as well. From 2016 to 2020, a total of 1,200 kilometers of coastline and 230 square kilometers of coastal wetlands were restored. About 25 percent of the global green area that increased from 2000 to 2017 was in China, making it the largest contributor in the world. The forest coverage and the steppe vegetation coverage reached 23 percent and 56.1 percent in 2021, respectively.,China has also taken time and effort to work on environmental improvement. The average concentration of PM2.5 has dropped 34.8 percent from 2015 to 2021, representing the world's fastest rate of air quality improvement. In 2021, days with good or moderate air quality accounted for 87.5 percent of the year. ,""I look forward to seeing the parties, international organizations and stakeholders demonstrate the spirit of international cooperation, show political determination and the utmost sincerity during the second phase of the meeting, fully demonstrate flexibility, and actively seek agreement on key issues,"" Huang said. "
