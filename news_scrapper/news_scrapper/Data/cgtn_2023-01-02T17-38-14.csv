The RCEP approaches its first anniversary,"

    10:55, 01-Jan-2023

            ","After a marathon of 31 rounds of negotiations in eight years, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), which includes the 10 ASEAN members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam) and Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and the Republic of Korea, was signed in November 2020. From January 2022, the RCEP has officially taken effect.,Amid a fast-changing global geostrategic environment, the conclusion of the RCEP agreement demonstrates that member countries have delivered a signal of support for free trade and multilateralism with pragmatic measures, and support rules-based multilateral trade.,The huge consumer market and economic strength of RCEP member countries will lead to an increase in real trade in the Asia-Pacific region, and bring new business opportunities for enterprises in member countries to expand investment and increase market share.,ASEAN has played a crucial role in the RCEP, from the start of negotiations, which were initiated in 2012 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, to the final agreement that was formally signed by the 15 RCEP member nations when the negotiations were completed during Vietnam's chairmanship of ASEAN. By leading the RCEP negotiation process, ASEAN has consolidated its pivotal position in formulating regional trade rules and promoting regional economic integration. ,As the RCEP will help ASEAN countries' economies integrate into the global economy, and this agreement will benefit ASEAN's less developed member countries to accelerate industrialization and enhance their capability to participate in regional industrial chains, thereby driving their own economic growth and narrowing the economic development gap with developed member countries.,The RCEP approaches its first anniversary and the agreement has boosted cross-trade of its member countries thanks to the reduction of tariffs and measures taken to facilitate trade. The flow of logistics, people and capital within the RCEP countries has become more frequent and convenient. Thai exports of goods, such as automobiles, have benefitted from an export dividend from expanded market access and the elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The RCEP has also injected a vital impetus to Cambodia's trade growth in the post COVID-19 pandemic era. Cambodia's trade with other member countries was valued at $4.7 billion for the first nine months of 2022, up 11 percent year-on-year. ,In the case of Singapore, it was the first country to ratify the agreement. As one of the signatories to the RCEP, Singapore can enjoy an average tariff elimination of about 92 percent for traded goods, progressively over the next 20 years. This can enable preferential market access allowing Singaporean producers to be more competitive in regional markets. Singapore's financial services sector will see increased demand for banking, insurance and other financial services delivered to companies in member countries through the financial services liberalization chapter of the agreement.,China is an important driver of regional free trade and trade multilateralism. China's imports and exports to other RCEP member countries for the period between January and November 2022 increased by 7.9 percent year-on-year. The ASEAN countries combined maintain their positions as China's largest trading partners. From Cambodian rice to Thai coconut perfume, Vietnamese passion fruit and durian, more and more ASEAN agricultural products are becoming more easily accessible to the Chinese market.,The RCEP will usher in new business opportunities for Chinese companies and direct investment in ASEAN. In 2022, the Chinese electric vehicle company BYD announced that it will set up an electric vehicle factory in Thailand, which is expected to produce over 150,000 electric vehicles per year after completion in 2024 to supply the market in Thailand and other ASEAN countries. The Thailand plant will be BYD's first electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Southeast Asia and the company's first passenger car plant overseas.,BYD's investment would strengthen Thailand's development as an automobile manufacturing center and new energy industry in Southeast Asia, as well as help Chinese enterprises take advantage of relevant technological advantages to expand outbound investment and ASEAN market opportunities, and will strengthen cooperation between China and ASEAN in the field of manufacturing.,Nevertheless, the RCEP has certain limitations. First, the RCEP is not the most open free trade agreement. It lacks the depth and breadth of a full free trade agreement, and only around 90 percent of industries and products are covered by zero tariffs. Secondly, the RCEP agreement does not set strict standards and restrictions on member countries in terms of intellectual property protection, state-owned enterprises, labor market, competition policy and Internet rules. These aspects not covered by the RCEP agreement represent important policy directions and new opening up negotiations for the future construction of a high-level regional free trade area.,The RCEP cannot achieve the goal of reforming global economic and trade rules, and its goal instead is to meet the challenges of the global economic downturn and decline in international market demand by accelerating regional economic integration.,By consolidating the RCEP agreement, market access between member countries can be expanded, and two-way investment areas and sectors can be increased, so as to expand the scale of intra-regional trade and find new export markets for surplus capacity."

The existing conservation measures for coffee are not sufficient.,Also, a new study published in the journal , simulates how the growth conditions of three popular foods (coffee, cashews and avocados) will change over the next 30 years.,Of the three crops, coffee is being hit hardest by global warming: the study predicts that the number of areas where coffee can be grown will decline across the board by 2050. The main reason for the decline is higher annual temperatures in coffee-producing countries such as Brazil, Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.,Arabica coffee is one of the two main plants used to harvest coffee beans. This plant evolved in the high-altitude tropics of Ethiopia and is very sensitive to climate change.,However, how can coffee bean production be maintained under global warming? In a recent review published in Nature Plants, scientists from the Royal Botanic Gardens argue that Liberian coffee, once rated the second most traded coffee crop variety, could re-emerge to help sustain coffee production in a warming climate.,The authors argue that there are three ways to help coffee cultivation adapt to a changing climate: move coffee production to more suitable areas. Adapt coffee growing methods. Developing coffee crops that are better adapted to future climate conditions. They suggest that changing crop types is likely to be the least disruptive and most cost-effective approach. The Liberian species of coffee was once widely grown in the second half of the 19th century because it was productive, resistant to pests and diseases, and could grow in warmer ground to which Arabica coffee did not adapt. However, in the early 20th century, interest in this coffee was lost because of its inconsistent quality and profitability, among other issues.,The authors state that the initially introduced Liberian coffee fruit and seeds were difficult to process and therefore unpopular with coffee traders. In contrast, there has been a recent expansion of excelsa coffee (a Liberian species of coffee) in Africa. This coffee bean and fruit is similar to Arabica and produces a mild and smooth coffee with low acidity and bitterness, but contains equal amounts of caffeine.,Researchers believe that in a changing climate, in a warmer climate and at a lower altitude than that in which Arabica is grown, the Liberian species offers the potential to grow a commercially viable and perhaps even more valuable coffee."

            ","Considered one of China's most talented contemporary artists, Zhang Zhanzhan is known for his human portraits and animal sculptures, especially his red bear series. ,""While many people haven't heard of Zhang Zhanzhan before, they have seen his bear, the red bear,"" said Serena Zhao, founder of ArtDepot Gallery. ""Some think having one of Zhang's bear sculptures in their home will bring happiness. His fans span a wide range, from two- or three-year-old kindergarten children to 50 or 60-year-old women. He's especially popular among male fans who were born in the 1980s or 1990s."",Born in the 1980s, gallery visitor Hou Shiwei is a typical fan. Looking in on Zhang's latest solo exhibition at Beijing's ArtDepot, he was immediately attracted by the exhibits.,""Many of his works remind me of my own experiences,"" said Hou. ""The background of many of his works is black, and the main characters are painted bright red, highlighting the inner feelings of the figures, with the background featuring a particularly dark process. Murakami Haruki once said when you come out of a storm, you won't be the same person as the one who walked in. This was what I was thinking when I was viewing Zhang's paintings."",While majoring in sculpture at the Nanjing University of the Arts, Zhang dedicated much of his early professional career to finding his distinctive creative style.,""I think everybody is lonely,"" the artist said. ""Some of us may not know it. I try to depict the emotions people have: loneliness, pain, happiness, and joy. Everyone feels some of these, more or less. I hope to express such common feelings."",His efforts have paid off, with many saying his works bring them great comfort and healing.,""When I was out there, a cloud drifted past, allowing the sunlight to reflect on that rabbit sculpture,"" said one visitor. ""It looked like it was quietly contemplating, and that scene touched me. I think great artists catch viewers immediately with their own language or other details."",Although Zhang's works are mainly popular among young people, they are not simply categorized as fashion art, according to Serena Zhao. ""Last year, at an art gallery academic seminar, we discussed whether Zhang Zhanzhan's works belong to fashion art or contemporary art. The fans of contemporary art are supposed to be a smaller group, including private collectors. And fashion art is more popular and accessible to everyone. We agreed that Zhang Zhanzhan is influential in both areas."",In recent years Zhang has created a number of pieces of public art. Many of them have become city landmarks. He hopes viewers can interact with his outdoor installations. That way, his art will bring happiness and comfort to the public."

The revisions regarding the foreign-related stipulations include further enhancing the jurisdiction rules of Chinese courts over foreign civil and commercial cases, properly coordinating the conflict of jurisdiction, enriching the means of service of process involving foreign affairs, adding the provisions of extraterritorial investigation and evidence collection, and improving rules of recognizing and enforcing the verdicts made by foreign courts, Zhou said.,At the Central Conference on Comprehensively Advancing the Rule of Law in November 2020, the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee proposed to advance the domestic and foreign-related rule of law in a coordinated manner, putting forward higher requirements for foreign-related legal work. Zhou stressed that enhancing foreign-related legal provisions in the civil procedure law will provide equal protection for foreign parties and create a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment, which is crucial to China's development interests.,Zhou introduced that to better improve the civil procedure law, the Supreme People's Court actively cooperated with the legislative organs, comprehensively summarized China's experience in trials of foreign civil and commercial disputes, and at the same time, learned from international treaties and foreign legislative experience. After in-depth investigation and research, wide opinion soliciting, and repeated revision and discussion, the Supreme People's Court formed their suggestions for the foreign-related legal revisions of the civil procedure law.,Other non-foreign related revisions in the civil procedure law mainly include expanding the scope of avoidance, clarifying the rules for judicial technicians to participate in litigation, improving the rules for identifying false litigation, adjusting the way of presenting appeals, and enhancing retrial application procedures and standards."

Now, China has its own rising NFT artist: Song Ting.,By combining artificial intelligence technology with traditional art, poetry and drama, she creates conceptual artwork that reimagines traditional Chinese culture.,""For me, coding language and Chinese, especially in traditional Chinese literature, are two kinds of language that have shaped me from soul to body,"" said Song.,One of her popular works is a psychedelic digital recreation of a Buddha statue from the Mogao Grottoes, a 1,000-year-old cultural site in northwest China's Gansu Province. By using software including Adobe, Blender and Unity, she makes the statue dance. ,She also created the first digital art piece to be auctioned by China Guardian.

""I asked them, What is love in your heart? What is confusion? And what is hope?' They handed me their answers.

Musical interpretation adds vitality to classic literature,"

    14:12, 29-Dec-2022

            ","Red Cliff was the site of a major battle over 1,800 years ago during the Three Kingdoms (220-280) period that saw the underdog emerge victorious. In 1082, the writer Su Shi (1037-1101) from the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127) traveled to this historic site and wrote two ""Odes to the Red Cliff,"" significantly contributing to the annals of Chinese literature. Artists of subsequent dynasties created numerous works to commemorate Su Shi and his odes, including the ""Red Cliff"" painting by Qiu Ying from the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). With his strong imagination and distinct painting style, Qiu Ying depicted the scene of Su Shi taking a boat trip with his friends. It recreated the atmosphere of a moonlit night from bygone centuries, conveying a strong sense of aesthetics with deep cultural connotations. Produced by China Media Group, the cultural program ""China in Poetry and Painting"" invited musical actors Zheng Qiyuan, Pang Shengzhi, and Zhao Yujun to perform a musical play based on the painting ""Red Cliff,"" expressing positive sentiments toward nature with a detached and free attitude.,""Red Cliff"" was drawn by the famous painter Qiu Ying during the Ming Dynasty and is now housed in the Liaoning Provincial Museum. In this masterpiece, a boat is seen drifting slowly along a river, in which Su Shi is drinking wine and chatting with his friends, projecting a peaceful and calm atmosphere. A precipitous cliff sits beside the boat. The surface of the precipice is a jumble of trees and vegetation. Trees tower up into the sky, some of their branches waving lightly in the wind.,The river is depicted using simplistic lines, while the cliff and trees are stacked closely using a variety of colors, making for a striking comparison. As Su Shi wrote, ""White mist heaped up across the river, and the moonlight stretched far into the horizon to merge with the hues of the sky. Like a piece of reed, our boat drifted on a boundless expanse of water, so vast that we felt as if we were riding in the wind."" Amid such wondrous scenery of mountains and rivers, Su Shi dissolved his sorrows and freed himself of concerns such as glory and dishonor.,Su Shi is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished figures in classical Chinese literature, having produced some of the most well-known poems, prose, and essays in its history. However, he had an unstable career as a court official. Su Shi had been demoted many times, but the move that had the greatest impact on him was the famous ""Wutai Poetry Case,"" which saw him punished for a spell during the Northern Song Dynasty due to a literary controversy. Nearly a millennium ago, he was exiled to Hangzhou as a result of this case. This marked a turning point in his life. But while he experienced great hardship, his attitude toward life also changed. He became more open-minded and dedicated himself into his works, notably his ""Odes to the Red Cliff,"" which is regarded as a milestone in the annals of Chinese literature. It is on the basis of this classic literary work that Qiu Ying managed to complete the masterpiece ""Red Cliff."",Qiu Ying, born into a poor family and largely self-taught, was adept at adding interest to his works. The painting style of ""Red Cliff"" is refined and realistic and has a poetic and graceful air reminiscent of literati art. According to Fan Di'an, dean of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the masterpiece was drawn from a unique angle of vision – overlooking the river and looking far ahead to the mountains – as if standing on the cliff.,On the stage of ""China in Poetry and Painting,"" the musical actor Zheng Qiyuan, being cast as the protagonist Su Shi, performs a musical play based on the painting ""Red Cliff."" On a crisp fall evening, Su Shi travels on a small boat to visit the Red Cliff with his friends. They recall the Battle of Red Cliff – an event that happened over 1,800 years ago – and start to think about the rise and fall of great historical figures. They talk about the brevity of life and the profound beauty of nature in a musical form, adding a novel touch to these ancient philosophical insights.,Despite having different historical backgrounds, Su Shi and Qiu Ying shared similar spiritual aspirations. No matter the circumstances, they never gave up hope and always maintained their deep love for life. Their ability to draw strength from nature epitomizes the character of the Chinese people, helping the country to maintain its enduring vitality while confronting the dramatic changes of time."

""This shift is science-based, timely and necessary."",""This is also important from a strategic and long-term perspective for effectively coordinating COVID response with economic and social development and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people."",As response measures are being refined, relevant Chinese departments have worked actively to beef up medical resources, set up a multi-tiered and category-based diagnosis and treatment mechanism, and increased the production capacity and supply of medicines, Wang noted.,The spokesperson added the country has mobilized as many resources as possible to protect the elderly with underlying health conditions, pregnant and lying-in women, children and other key groups, and made every effort to reduce severe cases and deaths.,Several places around the world were reported to have imposed curbs on travelers from China such as requiring them to take COVID-19 tests after Beijing relaxed strict COVID-19 measures. ,Commenting on such a situation, Wang stressed China always believes that for all countries, COVID response measures need to be science-based and proportionate and apply equally to people of all countries without affecting normal travel and people-to-people exchange and cooperation.,Noting he has also noticed that many countries have said at the moment they do not plan to adjust their entry measures for travelers from China, Wang expressed the hope that countries will follow a science-based response approach and work together to ensure safe cross-border travel, keep global industrial and supply chains stable, and contribute to global solidarity against COVID and the world economic recovery."

Chinese artist's masterpiece captures poetry of modern life,"

    12:56, 30-Dec-2022

            ","Through the mists of time, the sound of a rattling drum is wakening a tranquil water town. The itinerant merchant announces his wares to all along the street. The varied items are meant to fulfill people's yearnings for a better life. The colorful fabrics and elegant floral hairclips will soon find their proud owners. Translated into ""The Itinerant Merchant,"" painted by Chinese artist Ya Ming in 1958, this scene epitomizes a new era. ,Since the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), the image of the itinerant merchant has served as a classic subject in many Chinese paintings. Historians can trace a timeline through the centuries in those artistic creations based on daily life. Ya Ming has renewed this timeless figure by bringing a sense of historical imagination into modern times through his innovative approach and ingenuity.,Born in 1924, Ya Ming developed a passion for painting when he was a child. His love of Chinese fine arts survived the perilous wartime years. In 1939, the 15-year-old joined the army while he was in Huainan, Anhui. As a wartime painter, he created a series of images to show his support for the revolutionary struggles.,After the war ended, Ya Mingwas given the opportunity to study and copy classical paintings from bygone centuries. He benefited from the instruction of master painters and gained fresh insights into the fine arts.,By 1956, the city of Suzhou had recovered its former prosperity. While penning some sketches at Taihu Lake, Ya Ming came across the inspiration that would lead to the birth of “The Itinerant Merchant.”,The most vibrant colors in the water town emanated from the local village girls. Their distinctive ornaments and clothing conveyed a brimming sense of hope and elation in a land bathed in sunshine. Such brightness helped Ya Ming forget the darkness of the war years.,As the painter occupied himself with sketching, an itinerant vendor passed by and reminded him of the juxtaposition of traditional and modern life. The merchant sparked his imagination. Ya Ming had found an outlet for his creative energy and decided to paint a contemporary itinerant merchant.,However, the portrayal had to be anchored on the subject’s real life. Rather than focusing solely on the vendor and the children around him, Ya Ming assigned a considerable visual weight to the industrious Suzhou women. ,Like the notes of a mellifluous song, Ya Ming's brushstrokes infused the scene with a sense of poetry. As the sight reminded him of his wife rehearsing with her fellow professional dancers, he transferred the graceful swaying postures to the characters on his canvas.,""If a painting is too conventional and formulaic, it will leave no impression on the viewer. Now a painting like this has transformed the patterns established by ancient classics. In its characterization, it has boldly blended in various heart-lifting elements from the 1950s,"" said Yu Yang, an art critic from the Central Academy of Fine Arts, as he shared his thoughts on Ya Ming's masterpiece. ,In the panorama of life in the 1950s, Ya Ming quietly included the dove and some items bearing the brand name ""peace."" After witnessing the cruelties of war, the artist insisted on celebrating the era of peace. Thus, traditional artistic techniques converged with a more contemporary spirit.,From the enigmatic patterns of historic pottery to a holy beast inscribed on bronze, from the romanticism of the ancient kingdom of Chu to the aspirations of poets from the Tang Dynasty (618-907), artists have always sounded the most vigorous notes of their times. ""The Itinerant Merchant"" has renewed this tradition."

            ","Chaired by China, the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) has reached an encouraging agreement.,The Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), a UN deal aimed at reversing biodiversity loss and setting the world on a path of recovery, was adopted ahead of schedule.,The adoption of the framework is ""a bold step forward to protect nature, to protect the air that we breathe, the water that we drink,"" commented Steven Guilbeault, Canadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change.,One of the landmark consensuses reached in the framework is the ""30 by 30"" goal, meaning to protect at least 30 percent of lands, oceans, coastal areas and inland waters by 2030. Also, delegates agreed to establish a multilateral fund within the framework for the equitable sharing of benefits between providers and users of Digital Sequence Information that contains pharmaceutical product development, and improved crop breeding. It will be finalized at COP16 in Türkiye in 2024.,""China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection as chair of COP15,"" said Peng Kui, program manager of the Ecosystem Conservation & Community Development Program of Global Environment Institute.,During the conference, China helped form synergy from all parties, including national delegates, the scientific community, the private sector as well as other interest groups concerning environmental protection. The country played a crucial role in closing gaps to reach an ambitious and practical framework that the international community has been expecting.,Still, financial issues added tension to the negotiations but were partly smoothed by the coordination of China, Peng told CGTN. For instance, although the reduction of annual harmful government subsidies by $500 billion is very controversial, it was finally put in the conference's final report.,The framework also demands raising international financial flows from developed to developing countries, in particular, least developed countries, small island developing states and countries with economies in transition, to at least 20 billion U.S. dollars annually by 2025, and to at least 30 billion dollars annually by 2030.,The adoption of the framework and the associated package of ambitious targets, goals and financing represents a first step in resetting our relationship with the natural world, said Inger Andersen, Under-Secretary-General of the UN and Executive Director of the UN Environment Program in a statement at the closing plenary of COP15.,Apart from closely cooperating with all parties and stakeholders towards the conclusion of the GBF, China also showed the ability to make quick and firm decisions at critical moments, according to Peng.,To facilitate the negotiation in the last few days, a ministerial meeting was held in which ministers from developed and developing countries helped working groups to discuss thorny issues like the protection of the right of indigenous people and local communities, as well as the Digital Sequence Information on genetic resources. China also brought forward a presidential text on the broad consensus reached during the meeting.,""I think there is cautious optimism as with the adoption of Global Biodiversity Framework. Although difficulties lie in realizing these goals in practice in the future, the global biodiversity framework offers a balanced guidance for all parties and brings confidence to global efforts in biodiversity protection and sustainable development,"" said Peng.,Since the first part of the COP15 was held in 2021 in Kunming, Southwest China's Yunnan Province, China has convened nearly 40 meetings of the presidium and more than 100 bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings and seminars at different levels to promote greater consensus among all parties.,China takes the lead in preserving biodiversity as it has launched 10 pilot national parks since 2015. The protection area covers nearly 30 percent of the national key protected wild animals and plants in the land area.,On Thursday, China selected 49 areas in 28 provinces for building more national parks, according to a spatial layout plan released by the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. The national park system will be the largest in the world in terms of protected areas if all 49 candidate parks are built, and brings ecological corridors under protection,,""By 2035, China will basically complete the development of its national park system,"" said Li Chunliang, deputy head of the administration, said at a news conference, adding that the national parks will be jointly developed through franchising, volunteer services and ecological management."

The year 2023 is approaching. From Beijing, I extend my best New Year wishes to all of you.,In 2022, we successfully convened the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC). An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.,The Chinese economy has remained the second largest in the world and enjoyed sound development. GDP for the whole year is expected to exceed 120 trillion yuan. Despite a global food crisis, we have secured a bumper harvest for the 19th year in a row, putting us in a stronger position to ensure the food supply of the Chinese people. We have consolidated our gains in poverty elimination and advanced rural revitalization across the board. We have introduced tax and fee cuts and other measures to ease the burden on businesses, and made active efforts to solve the most pressing difficulties of high concern to the people.,Since COVID-19 struck, we have put the people first and put life first all along. Following a science-based and targeted approach, we have adapted our COVID response in light of the evolving situation to protect the life and health of the people to the greatest extent possible. Officials and the general public, particularly medical professionals and community workers, have bravely stuck to their posts through it all. With extraordinary efforts, we have prevailed over unprecedented difficulties and challenges, and it has not been an easy journey for anyone. We have now entered a new phase of COVID response where tough challenges remain. Everyone is holding on with great fortitude, and the light of hope is right in front of us. Let's make an extra effort to pull through, as perseverance and solidarity mean victory.,Comrade Jiang Zemin passed away in 2022. We pay high tribute to his towering achievements and noble demeanor, and cherish the great legacy he left behind. We will honor his last wishes and advance the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.,Wave upon wave, the mighty river of history surges forward. With the persistent efforts of one generation after another, we have taken China to where it is today.,Today's China is a country where dreams become reality. The Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games concluded with a resounding success. Chinese winter sports athletes gave their all and achieved extraordinary results. Shenzhou-13, Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 soared into the heavens. China's space station was fully completed and our ""home in space"" is roving in the deep-blue sky. The people's armed forces marked the 95th birthday and all service members are marching confidently on the great journey of building a strong military. China's third aircraft carrier Fujian,was launched. C919, China's first large passenger aircraft, was delivered. And the Baihetan hydropower station went into full operation... None of these achievements would have been possible without the sweat and toil of the numerous Chinese people. Sparks of talent are coming together, and they are the strength of China!,Today's China is a country brimming with vigor and vitality. Various pilot free trade zones and the Hainan Free Trade Port are booming, innovations are gushing out in the coastal areas, development is picking up pace in the central and western regions, the momentum for revitalization is building in the northeast, and there is greater development and affluence in the border regions.,The Chinese economy enjoys strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality. The fundamentals sustaining its long-term growth have remained strong. As long as we stay confident and strive for progress while maintaining stability, we will realize the goals we have set. ,On my visit to Hong Kong earlier this year, I was deeply glad to see that Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive again. With determined implementation of One Country, Two Systems, Hong Kong and Macao will surely enjoy long-term prosperity and stability.,Today's China is a country that keeps to its national character. In the course of 2022, we encountered various natural disasters including earthquakes, floods, droughts and wildfires, and experienced some workplace accidents. Amid those disconcerting and heartbreaking scenes, there have emerged numerous touching stories of people sticking together in face of adversity or even sacrificing their lives to help others in distress. Those heroic deeds will be forever etched in our memories. At every turn of the year, we always think of the great character of resilience that the Chinese nation has carried forward through millennia. It gives us still greater confidence as we continue our way forward.,Today's China is a country closely linked with the world. Over the past year, I have hosted quite a few friends, both old and new, in Beijing; I have also traveled abroad to communicate China's propositions to the world. Changes unseen in a century are unfolding at a faster pace, and the world is not yet a tranquil place. We cherish peace and development and value friends and partners as we have always done. We stand firm on the right side of history and on the side of human civilization and progress. We work hard to contribute China's wisdom and solutions to the cause of peace and development for all humanity.,After the 20th CPC National Congress, my colleagues and I visited Yan'an. We were there to relive the inspiring episode in which the Party's central leadership overcame extraordinary difficulties in the 1930s and 1940s, and to draw on the spiritual strength of the older generation of CPC members. I often say, ""Just as polishing makes jade finer, adversity makes one stronger."" Over the past 100 years, the CPC has braved wind and rain, and forged ahead against all odds. That is a most difficult yet great journey. Today, we must press on courageously to make tomorrow's China a better place.,Going forward, China will be a country that performs miracles through hard work. Here I want to quote Su Shi, a renowned Chinese poet, ""Charge at the toughest and aim at the farthest."" It means to take on the biggest challenges and go after the most ambitious goals. Long as the journey is, we will reach our destination if we stay the course; difficult as the task is, we will get the job done if we keep working at it. As long as we have the resolve to move mountains and the perseverance to plod on, as long as we keep our feet on the ground and forge ahead with our journey by making steady progress, we will turn our grand goals into reality.,Going forward, China will be a country that draws its strength from unity. Ours is a big country. It is only natural for different people to have different concerns or hold different views on the same issue. What matters is that we build consensus through communication and consultation. When the 1.4 billion Chinese work with one heart and one mind, and stand in unity with a strong will, no task will be impossible and no difficulty insurmountable. The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are members of one and the same family. I sincerely hope that our compatriots on both sides of the Strait will work together with a unity of purpose to jointly foster lasting prosperity of the Chinese nation.,Going forward, China will be a country that has great expectations of its younger generation. A nation will prosper only when its young people thrive. For China to develop further, our young people must step forward and take on their responsibilities. Youth is full of vigor and is a source of hope. Youngsters should keep their country in mind, cultivate keen enterprise, and live youth to the fullest with great drive, to prove worthy of the times and the splendor of youth.,To the many people who are still busy working at this very moment, I salute you all! We are about to ring in the New Year. Let us welcome the first ray of sunshine of 2023 with the best wishes for a brighter future.,May our country enjoy prosperity and our people live in harmony. May the world enjoy peace and people of all countries live in happiness. I wish you all a happy New Year and may all your wishes come true.,Thank you."

Chinese space station epitome of aerospace workers' wisdom: designer,"

    11:20, 01-Jan-2023

            ","The successful building of the space station, the final goal of China's ""three-step"" human space program initiated 30 years ago, demonstrated the wisdom, ability and creativity of Chinese aerospace workers, said the chief designer of the country's manned space program recently. ,China's space station with a three-module configuration consists of the core module Tianhe and two lab modules Wentian and Mengtian. ,With the successful launch of the Mengtian lab module into orbit and its successful rendezvous and docking and transposition with the Tianhe core module, the assembly of the space station's T-shape basic structure was completed in orbit. ,In 1992 when constructing a manned orbiting laboratory was still a flight of fancy for the Chinese people, China embarked on a ""three-step"" strategy to develop its human space program. ,The first step was to send astronauts into space and ensure their safe return. The second step was developing advanced space flight techniques and technologies including extravehicular activity and orbital docking. The third step was to assemble and operate a permanent manned space station. ,The construction of the space station is a milestone in China's space industry. To achieve this goal, China has been pushing space exploration boundaries on its own over the past three decades. ,As the chief designer of China's manned space program, Zhou Jianping has fully participated in and presided over the construction and development of the ""three-step"" strategic mission. ,""Up to now, we have completed the construction of our space station, which should be a perfect milestone in the realization of China's three-step manned space mission. We can proudly say that the space station we have completed is capable of meeting the needs of space science research in various fields by adopting the most advanced technology of our time. It has also played a significant role in the development of China's space industry,"" said Zhou. ,Compared with the International Space Station, China's space station started late with a limited foundation. Only with the experience of building the Tiangong-1 and Tiangong-2, the two eight-tonne space laboratories, has China entered the construction stage of the space station, opening its own path of space station construction. ,""Right from the beginning, we had a clear goal, that is, to complete the space station with the experimental core module as the official core module. We anticipated the technical difficulties and risks involved. This required us to perform each task more substantially on Earth, and each experiment more closely to the celestial environment, though it was impossible to replicate the same environment in space,"" said Zhou.,""As we all know, space is a micro-gravity environment. When we stretch a 15-meter-long robotic arm on Earth, it bends down, let alone working. Our scientists and engineers have used their wisdom to solve all these problems. We completed the three modules for the space station in just over a year. This also demonstrates the ability, creativity, confidence and responsibility of the Chinese space workers,"" he said.,At present, two phases of the mission objectives have been completed: key technology verification and in-orbit construction. During the period, China has achieved comprehensive breakthroughs in regenerative environmental control and life support technology, flexible solar cell wing driving mechanism, robotic arm auxiliary module rotation, large assembly control and other technologies. ,In the meantime, the whole project always puts human safety in the first place, and has constantly improved mission reliability through strict control over product quality, full testing to expose problems, and in-depth analysis of principles and mechanisms. ,""I think one of the most important things is that I was determined to make the Chinese space station the most economical space station with advanced technology. With respect to the economics of our space station, undoubtedly, it's the most advanced of all the space stations,"" said the chief designer.,""Thanks to technological advancement, we can dramatically reduce the cost of future supplies to the space station, which is a model of high-quality development. We have covered all the frontiers of international space science research. We have also made our contribution to the improvement of the overall level and capability of human space science,"" Zhou said. ,The successful completion of the space station is not only an important milestone in China's manned space program, but also a new starting point for further development in outer space. ,""Our space station will enter the full application stage. It's safe to say that it is a very important space science research and experiment platform for us to build an innovative country. Our next goal is to conduct manned moon landing in the near future,"" said Zhou."

What is the ilu in Avatar?,"

    15:13, 01-Jan-2023

            ","We are diving into the deep: this time, into an otherworldly ocean. ""Avatar: The Way of Water,”directed by James Cameron, takes you to explore Pandora's glittering oceans.,In the movie, the ilu is the children's mount, an indispensable means of transportation for the seaside tribes. The ilu is intelligent, sociable and easily domesticated, with a long neck, six flippers and rudder-like tail, closely resembling Earth's extinct Plesiosaur species.,The Plesiosaur, which existed from 228 million years ago to 61.6 million years ago, was an aquatic reptile of the Jurassic period. It used four fins and a short broad tail for mobility, and had a serpentine neck almost as long as the rest of its body, with a small head at the end. It was at home in European seas and around the Pacific Ocean, including Australia, North America and Asia.,Beginning in 1824 when Victorian naturalist William Conybeare named Plesiosaurus after an almost complete skeleton, all types of Plesiosaurus – from small-headed, long-necked to large-headed, short-necked – used their four large flippers to flap and fly through the water. This way of swimming is very different from the lateral, fish-like manner of most other marine reptile lineages.,Scientists have long wondered about the Plesiosaur's neck – what did it do with such a long neck? British geologist William Conybeare believes that the long neck may have forced it to swim at the surface, arching its long neck like a swan, occasionally darting it down at the fish which happened to float within its reach, or the equivalent of a snake in the grass, relying on the suddenness and agility of its attacks.,However, paleontologists including a marine-reptile expert told National Geographic that the range of motion of the neck is limited by the flattened joint surfaces between the bones. ""The close fit, the relatively flat surface of the articulation between the vertebrae, and the lack of space between [projections of bone from the body of the vertebrae called] neural spines and transverse processes on adjoining vertebrae probably meant that there was little movement between the individual vertebrae,"" the expert said.,If they couldn't lift their heads out of the water to hunt, and they couldn't flexibly poke their heads out of hiding, how else could they forage for food? Apparently, the slender necks of these animals evolved for some adaptive reason and were very useful. ,Scientists are continuing to explore the secrets of the Plesiosaur."

Is China's economy outlook grim after COVID-19 policy shift? No!,"

    13:16, 01-Jan-2023

            ","Under the prism of some Western media, whatever China has done in its battle against COVID-19 is wrong. The same Western media outlets that harshly criticized China's dynamic zero-COVID policy are now saying the ""soar"" in infection cases, as a result of the country's lift of curbs in their words, is hurting the economy.,Bloomberg, for instance, is hyping that China's economy outlook is ""grim for the new year"" and its aggregate index of indicators show a contraction in activity in December from an already weak pace in November.,True, China may face some challenges in its retail sales and consumer spending in the early days when the country downgraded its level of COVID-19 management. But there is no need to make a fuss over it. The lifting of COVID-19 related restrictions doesn't mean an immediate rebound in economic growth. An increase of infection cases that could happen in any country – not just China – means that it takes time for people to get before they can go back to shops and restaurants.,Latest figures have already shown the revival of China's consumption market. Since the shift in COVID-19 policy, the attendance at some movie theaters in Beijing has returned to 75 percent of the regular level and popular diners have posted more than 80 percent of customer traffic, China's Xinhua News Agency reported.,The optimization of COVID-19 response means Chinese residents will be more willing to travel and spend. Consumption will become a major driving force for economic growth, chief economist with China Securities Huang Wentao said in a recent interview with Xinhua. Wu Chaoming, chief economist with Chasing International Economic Institute, believes that the per capita consumption expenditure of Chinese residents would increase from 8 percent to 12 percent in the new year.,Many foreign firms are also upbeat about China's economic outlook. ""Although it (China's downgrade of COVID-19 management) might bring some challenges in the short term, we believe we will see a meaningful recovery in the long run,"" said Kenichi Tanaka, president of Fujifilm (China) Investment Co., Ltd, as Xinhua reported.,But in some Western media's coverage, everything concerning China is turned upside down. In their eye, the shift in COVID-19 management could lead to a ""grim"" economic outlook, but in the meantime, the country's dynamic zero-COVID policy meant a failed economy.,Has the previous dynamic zero-COVID policy resulted in poor economic performances? Admittedly, the arduous anti-virus battle over the past three years has caused some disruptions. But the Chinese economy has managed to consolidate its resilience. It has not only guaranteed people's basic livelihood, but also outstripped the majority of countries in trade volume and production.,Against the backdrop of the global virus-induced economic trough, China's gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 4.6 percent from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2022, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is well above the world average. The figure of the United States – the world's largest economy – stood at 1.6 percent during the same period. Major developed countries including Germany, France, Britain, and Japan saw their GDP expanding at below 0.5 percent.,In addition, compared with the U.S. that saw its inflation rate surging to a four-decade high, China has kept this figure at a relatively low level. According to the Moody's Analytics 2022 data, soaring inflation caused ordinary American families to fork out $445 more per month compared to a year ago. While the skyrocketing costs of food, energy, and shelter put extra pressure on millions of American households already struggling with their family budget, China is seeing a decline in food prices – a 0.8 percent drop month-on-month in November, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed.,China's dynamic zero-COVID policy in the past three years can never be equated to a close-door policy. According to the General Administration of Customs, China's foreign trade of goods expanded 8.6 percent year-on-year to 38.34 trillion yuan (5.78 trillion U.S. dollars) in the first 11 months of 2022.,Fact speaks louder than words. Amidst the changing situation, China's COVID-19 policy is under constant adjustments. Chinese people, rather than those Western media outlets, have the ultimate say on the effects of their country's policy."

It is typical to southern Shaolin Kung Fu and was officially listed as a form of national intangible cultural heritage in China in 2008.,Licheng says that Haican's wuzu fist ability has reached a good level in a short time. The technique has given him strength of body and mind, as each movement needs to be powerful yet calculated. Haican is often called on to demonstrate moves to the younger pupils.,Haican can also proudly wield the nine-section chain and perform the monkey fist. ""I enjoy learning kung fu with my classmates. I also like helping the young ones,"" Haican said, looking at Wenxuan, the youngest kung fu pupil at the temple. Living together and helping each other have given the boys a sense of maturity and inter-dependence.,The Southern Shaolin Temple in Quanzhou plans to keep the kung fu pupil program going, so more and more young people can have a taste of this traditional Chinese defense form. As for Haican, he wishes that one day he can be as good as his teacher Licheng."
