China stresses protection of the elderly after downgrading COVID response,"

    18:46, 13-Jan-2023

            ","China, with over 14 percent of its population aged above 65, has devoted great efforts to safeguarding the more vulnerable older people throughout its battle against COVID-19.,The efforts have been further emphasized and refined to protect the 200 million senior people since the country downgraded its COVID-19 management on January 8, with most restrictive measures such as mass testing and quarantine scraped in the country.,On January 7, China issued the 10th edition of its diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19, which stressed that people aged 65 and above, especially those not fully vaccinated, are at high risk for severe and critical illnesses and require special attention and management.,Real world data from other countries has shown that older people face a significantly higher mortality rate after Omicron infections. For example, nearly nine out of 10 deaths due to COVID-19 in the U.S. were in people 65 or older during the Omicron wave, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,Clinical data in China also shows that there is a higher proportion of severe and critically ill cases among people aged 65 and above with underlying diseases, especially those who have not been vaccinated against the virus, Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious disease department at Peking University's First Hospital, said at a press conference in Beijing on January 9.,Such people should be identified and given early intervention and treatment if they were infected, so as to minimize the risk of critical illness and death, Wang added.,China also released an instruction manual for COVID-19 control on January 7, in which a hierarchical medical care system for people aged 65 and above was introduced.,According to the system, the senior people at those ages will be further divided into three categories – high risk, medium risk and low risk – based on their ages, severity of underlying diseases and how many doses of vaccines they have received.,The high risk patients will be diagnosed by expert teams sent by health facilities at county level in rural areas or at district level in cities, who will evaluate whether the patients need to be hospitalized or can stay at home and receive medical care from clinics at the grassroots level. The clinics will help transfer the patients to higher level hospitals once needed.,For the medium risk people, the health facilities at grassroots level will offer medication guides and health monitoring services. They will also assist to transfer the patients to higher level hospitals once needed.,The low risk group will mainly receive basic preventive care by medical workers and health facilities at grassroots level, namely in communities, villages and townships.,China's Spring Festival travel rush, the largest human migration on Earth, is resuming this year from January 7 to February 15. In particular, the country's rural areas are facing a ""retaliatory travel"" surge from city residents.,When asked about the potential health risk during the holiday travel rush, Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission (NHC), told China Media Group (CMG) on January 8 that small- and medium-sized cities and rural areas have already experienced COVID-19 infection peak ahead of the travel rush.,Based on the trend of the epidemic, these areas are likely to experience a peak of emergency and severe cases, she said.,Compared with big cities, the rural areas are usually sparsely populated, with limited medical resources. The senior residents, especially those with underlying diseases and not fully vaccinated, are particularly vulnerable.,China's health authority has required the medical systems at county and village levels to get prepared, according to Jiao.,""On the one hand, we've asked counties and towns to prepare vehicles, so that patients in need could be transferred to the county-level hospitals immediately,"" Jiao told CMG.,""In addition, we have set up urban-rural hospital alliances over the years, so we can better utilize high-quality medical resources in the cities to help county-level hospitals,"" she said. ,The NHC also rolled out a plan on December 11 to enhance rural areas' medical services for the expected COVID-19 upsurge with detailed guidance and requirements. The plan underscores the importance of carrying out health monitoring for the elderly and those with underlying diseases in villages. It also asks county-level hospitals to increase medical supplies while setting up more fever clinics at villages and towns.,China has been encouraging the elderly to get fully vaccinated and take booster shots.,Among those aged 60 and older, about 70 percent received two jabs and a booster shot by December, official data showed.  "

244-million-year-old marine reptile fossil found in China's Yunnan,"

            ","Chinese paleontologists have discovered the fossil of a new marine reptile species, dating back 244 million years, in Luoping County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports on Thursday.,The species, named Luopingosaurus, is a lizard-like marine reptile. It is known as a pachypleurosaur with a long, pointed mouth, reaching more than half a meter in length. ,The long snout, accounting for over half of its head, facilitated the reptile to catch prey as it could largely reduce resistance during chases in the water, said Shang Qinghua, a researcher from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.,The discovery provided new insights into the early evolution of pachypleurosaur, Shang added.,According to the study, the reptile's forelegs had multiple phalanges, making its flippers more flexible when changing direction in the water. The discovery also represented the oldest fossil evidence of Sauropterygia with multiple phalanges.,The study also indicated that during the evolutionary process, the lateral grasping ability of pachypleurosaurs for small fish and other prey is gradually increasing, but the efficiency of swallowing after grasping is gradually decreasing.,During the Triassic period, Luoping was in a shallow marine environment, and the middle Triassic fossil bank found in the area is called the Luoping Biota. Once home to invertebrates, fish and a variety of marine reptiles, the Luoping Biota provides a new and early window on recovery and radiation of Triassic marine ecosystems around 10 million years after the great extinction at the end of the Permian period.,The first named marine reptile discovered in China was also a pachypleurosaur, namely Keichousaurus, found in 1957."

International medical experts speak out against COVID-19 restrictions on China,"

            ","Infectious disease experts around the world have voiced strong opposition to Western governments' restrictive policies towards travelers from China, describing the measures as unscientific, unnecessary and political shows.,Shortly after China optimized the COVID-19 strategy and announced the removal of COVID-19 related restrictions on international passenger flights from ,, countries such as the U.S., the UK, France, Italy, India, Australia and Japan started to impose restrictions on travelers from China, requiring them to obtain a negative COVID-19 test before departure.,The move sparked an outcry among the international medical community.,It's a ""public health theater,"" Preben Aavitsland, the subject director at the Division for Infection Control and Environmental Health of the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), and also a doctor and professor, tweeted after the UK imposed restrictions on December 31, 2022. ,""This looks like an infection prevention theater... they introduce measures so that it looks as if they are doing something for the population, but it has little meaning,"" Aavitsland told Norwegian online newspaper Nettavisen, also on December 31, 2022. ,""(Those restrictive measures) has no professional grounding, and will draw resources from more important work,"" he said, according to a translation of the interview, which was published in Norwegian.,""Europe, including Norway, is in the middle of a big wave with millions of people infected per week. Some visiting Chinese with infection will not affect the situation in Europe,"" he said.,Aavitsland's colleague Trygve Ottersen, the executive director of the same organization, was quoted by Nettavisen on Thursday as saying ""regarding the COVID test before departure, we believe it will have little significance for the epidemic in Norway. The recommendation for the use of face masks on flights from China is expected to be able to reduce infections on the flights somewhat, but to a modest extent."",The NIPH's experts' evaluation is also in line with the latest evaluation by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).,""The variants circulating in China are already circulating in the EU, and as such are not challenging for the immune response of EU/EEA (European Union/European Economic Area) citizens,"" according to a press release by ECDC on Tuesday.,Given the higher population immunity in the EU/EEA, as well as the prior emergence and subsequent replacement of variants currently circulating in China by other Omicron sub-lineages in the EU/EEA, a surge in cases in China is not expected to impact the COVID-19 epidemiological situation in the EU/EEA, the ECDC explained in the release.,""The screening rules and travel restrictions (imposed on travelers from China) weren't justified,"" the ECDC added, according to a report by Bloomberg on Wednesday.,In Asia, many medical experts have also said the restrictive measures are unnecessary.,Australia's Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly stated in a letter addressed to the Australian Health Minister Mark Butler on December 31, 2022,  ""I do not believe that there is sufficient public health rationale for imposing restrictions on travelers from China or any other country with a high burden of COVID-19 cases at present."",In the letter, Kelly said that he had also discussed the issue with chief health officers and public health officials from New Zealand, and ""there is strong consensus that implementation of any restrictions to travel from China at this time would be inconsistent with the current national approach to the management of COVID-19 and disproportionate to the risk."",Medical experts within Australia including Fiona Russell, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and vaccinologist at the University of Melbourne, and Peter McIntyre, former director of the National Centre for Immunization Research and Surveillance and professor at the universities of Sydney and Otago, drew the same conclusion as Kelly.,The current variants in China have already been circulating in Australia, and data shows that with each subsequent Omicron wave, there is a lower peak of hospitalizations and deaths due to higher population immunity, they wrote in a piece published on January 3 by the Sydney Morning Herald.,What's more important, ""such a punitive measure (restrictions on travelers from China) is a disincentive for countries to share reliable data in a timely manner,"" they emphasized.,Russell and McIntyre recommended that countries should upload data to the global genomics database so that genomic surveillance that identifies variants is enhanced. China has recently started to upload data since the country has just emerged from zero-COVID. ""This is encouraging but more needs to come,"" they commented.,The two experts also criticized India for lagging behind in uploading data. ""India, with 1 billion people, has uploaded about the same amount of information as Australia, with about 26 million."",In the U.S., Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, said it was ironic that as the U.S. sees a new surge of COVID-19 infections caused by the highly contagious Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 it is imposing unscientific curbs on travelers from China.,Although top medical experts from Europe, North America and Asia are against adopting restrictive and punitive measures against travelers from China based on scientific principles and the limited practical effects of those measures, policymakers in those regions are going against their advice.,The EU went against the ECDC and recommended its 27 member states impose restrictions on travelers from China on Wednesday. It's up to each state to decide whether they will follow EU recommendations, but the European Commission aims to coordinate rule across the region.,Although Norway is not a member of EU, it's a part of Europe and it belongs to the EEA. After the EU made the recommendation on Wednesday, the Norwegian government said it would support EU-coordinated measures related to COVID-19.,The NIPH's Otterson didn't criticize the government's assessment but emphasized that it is uncertain of the usefulness of the measures toward travelers from China, according to a report by Nettavisen on Thursday. Otterson commented that at the same time, European cooperation is valuable, so the Norwegian government must find common solutions with other countries.,A day after the chief medical officer made the suggestion, Australia followed the U.S., the UK and France in requiring a negative COVID-19 test from travelers from China.,""COVID-19 is with us forever..., but after three years and so many lessons on discriminatory policies, transparency, sustaining trust and improving communication, we should be establishing feasible and sustainable solutions that are not punitive and also support the global effort (in keeping the community safe and monitoring variants,"" said Russell and McIntyre. "

How China protects vulnerable rural areas under shadow of COVID-19?,"

    21:55, 07-Jan-2023

            ","As China's Spring Festival is coming soon, many will return to their hometowns for holidays. With the dense flow of travelers and frequent freight logistics activities, it will be a considerable test for the country to cope with a possible mass infection during the holidays. And with an undeveloped healthcare system and weak logistics distribution foundation, China's rural areas will have to suffer during the winter break.,To face up the challenges, the Chinese government is making full preparations for the possible mass infection during the upcoming Spring Festival, including measures to cope with the medical supply shortage, coordinate rural and urban medical resources, and ensure severely infected people get timely treatment.,The Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism of the State Council (JPCMSC) on Saturday afternoon introduced the situation of China's epidemic prevention and control measures in rural areas. Officials from the National Health Commission (NHC) and Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, experts and grassroots representatives attended the briefing.,Nie Chunlei, director of the Department of Primary Health of the NHC, said that epidemic prevention and control in rural areas has always been vital. The Chinese government has made a lot of arrangements to relieve the shortage of medical supplies.,The JPCMSC has set up a special supporting team and established a daily dispatch system to coordinate the distribution of medicines and other key medical supplies nationwide. Currently, priority is given to rural medical institutions, ensuring they have access to medicinal products, according to Nie.,He added that the NHC has conducted a daily monitoring, reporting and dispatch system for rural health organizations such as township health centers and community clinics. Once shortages of medical supplies, especially medicines, are found, they will take prompt measures to promote local governments to solve the problem.,Nie noted that for some drugs that are in short supply, the relevant departments had formulated various policies to support enterprises to expand production capacity, and the companies are working overtime to produce these medicines. He also encouraged rural areas to make full play of traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) if Western medicines such as febrifuge are not available at the time.,Regarding the logistics problem in rural areas, Nie said local governments should make centralized procurement to avoid one-after-another personal purchases which may cause a shortage of couriers.,""According to our monitoring, the problem of medicine shortage was prominent in the early days, but recently, with the increase of medicine production capacity and the strengthening of the organization of logistics by local governments, we found that the medicine shortage is gradually alleviating,"" Nie said.,To ensure efficient and orderly operation and treatment of severely infected people in rural areas, especially those with poor transportation, Nie said the State Council has guided local governments to carry out the following work.,First, using all kinds of tools like telephones, WeChat, cloud service, video and door-to-door service to strengthen daily contacts with key personnel and monitor their health so that once they're found in critical conditions, measures can be taken in the early stages.,Timely treatment requires rural medical and health institutions to expand the pre-hospital first-aid force, so the central government guided all township hospitals and community health centers to be equipped with at least one ambulance and to integrate the 120 first-aid system of each county into the national first-aid system so that a unified dispatch of ambulances can be guaranteed. Besides, for areas with difficulties to equip with an ambulance, a voluntary transport vehicle team should be built to ensure people can get a timely transfer.,Secondly, after ensuring the prompt transfer of patients, the mechanism for timely treatment should also be established. The State Council has asked second and third-tier public hospitals to allocate special personnel to take responsibility for the referral from first-tier hospitals, simplify the referral process and optimize the referral channel.,For the elderly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, patients with diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and other basic diseases, they should be promptly transferred to a medical institution with the treatment capacity, and if necessary, they can skip second-tier hospitals and be directly transferred to third-tier hospitals ,China has a 3-tier hospital system. They are designated as Primary, Secondary or Tertiary hospitals. A primary hospital is typically a township hospital that is tasked with providing preventive care, minimal health care and rehabilitation services. A secondary hospital tends to be affiliated with a medium size city, county or district and is responsible for providing comprehensive health services. A tertiary hospital is a comprehensive, referral, general hospital at the city, provincial or national level, which is responsible for providing specialist health services, performs a bigger role with regard to medical education and scientific research and serves as a medical hub providing care to multiple regions.,Nie emphasized that third-tier hospitals nationwide have been assigned to provide one-to-one guidance to county-level hospitals to strengthen medical treatment work and send medical staff to the grassroots level to guide the referral and medical treatment.,The State Council in last month had issued an overall guide for local governments, hospitals and relative departments to cope with the coronavirus as the country will downgrade the management of COVID-19 from Class A to Class B from January 8, which means mass testing and quarantine will be history, but the challenges hospitals and medical workers will have to face are becoming increasingly grave.,In the overall guide, its eighth clause rolled out general principles for the prevention and control measures in China's rural areas, saying local governments should fortify the coordinated medical service system at the county, township and village levels, strengthen the allocation of medical resources and equip key medical supplies such as oxygenators. And it also stressed the importance of urban and rural medical resources coordination, asking local governments to establish a mechanism of matching assistance between primary hospitals and superior hospitals so that smooth referrals can be guaranteed and people with severe diseases can get proper treatment."

            ","Foreign diplomats from more than 130 countries in China have expressed belief that China's optimization and adjustment of COVID-19 response and entry-exit policies are timely and necessary, and will provide an impetus for world economic recovery and growth.,The diplomats made the remarks on Friday at , on China's COVID-19 response policy for senior foreign diplomats in China, held by the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee. They added they appreciated China's support and assistance to the international community in responding to the challenges posed by the epidemic.,China has recently taken the initiative to refine its COVID-19 response measures. It adopted the 20 refined measures and 10 new measures and issued steps to treat COVID-19 as a Class-B instead of Class-A infectious disease. By shifting the response focus from stemming infection to preventing severe cases and caring for people's health, China aims to protect the lives and health of the people and reduce the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development to the maximum.,El Salvadoran Ambassador to China Aldo Alvarez said the adjustment ""comes right in time."" According to the new circumstances of epidemic prevention, the new characteristics of the variants, and China's reality, Alvarez thought it was time for China to make the policy adjustment based on science.,""China has tried its best to protect people's lives and health in the past three years,"" Fredrick P. Malire, the counselor of Malawi's embassy in China, said. He added that China's COVID-19 response policy adjustment would enhance the coordination and cooperation between China and other countries, thus providing impetus for the recovery of world economic growth.,Noting China is the second-largest economy in the world and an important trade partner to various countries, Malire said the policy adjustment means global trade will increase, which is no doubt ""good news for many countries."",During the briefing, experts from China's National Health Commission, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine introduced the scenarios of epidemic prevention and control in China and interacted with the diplomats.,The diplomats listened carefully to the introduction, learned the details and logic behind the adjustment of China's COVID-19 response policies, and appreciated China's achievements in fighting the epidemic and its outstanding contribution to the global fight.,While listening to the introductions, Luamanuvae Albert Mariner, Samoan Ambassador to China, took notes on China's experiences against the epidemic. ""One of the key pieces of information I noted is China's ongoing efforts to share data with the WHO,"" Mariner said. He added that it is really encouraging that China uses Western medicine as well as its own traditional medicine. China has also developed its own vaccines in response to the virus.,""COVID-19 is a global problem, and it requires a global solution. The only way to find this solution is through cooperation and dialogue,"" Mariner said. He said China sets a good example in this field.,""At the beginning of the epidemic, there was no other country willing to provide us with vaccines because they said they needed to cover their own population. China was the first friend who helped us and the only one there for us from the very beginning. El Salvador really wants to thank China for that,"" Alvarez said, adding that he got vaccines made in China.,Hassane Rabehi, Algerian ambassador to China, said that many developing countries received valuable support from China, including vaccines. That enabled their people to prepare for the epidemic. He thought of it as proof of China's work in supporting the international community in the fight against the epidemic, as well as the CPC's commitment to promoting the development of humanity's progress.,Rabehi mentioned, in particular, the important role of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in epidemic prevention and control. Before coming to work in China, his wife helped promote TCM in Algeria.,""I can assure you that most of the Algerian people who experienced the TCM were very happy and very appreciative of that,"" said Rabehi.,The rest of the world can say whatever they want about China, but something they have to acknowledge is that China's policy has effectively protected the lives and health of its people, Alvarez said, adding that recent restrictions posed by some countries targeting only Chinese tourists seem not to be based on any technical or scientific support.,The adjustment of China's entry-exit policies is really welcomed by Samoa, Mariner said, and they are ""looking forward to Chinese tourists to Samoa."""

It has also provided massive amounts of anti-pandemic supplies to more than 150 countries and 15 international organizations, and dispatched expert medical teams to 34 countries. China is playing an active role in controlling the pandemic and achieving stable economic recovery for the entire world.,During the past three years, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread around the world and the virus has continued to mutate. Coupled with other important factors such as the trade frictions between China and the United States and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the global supply chain has been severely disrupted and the world economy is recovering slowly.,As the ""world's factory,"" China has the most complete and largest industrial system on the planet and plays a ""ballast"" role in the global supply chain. China took the global lead in resuming production by implementing strict COVID-19 prevention measures and developing a set of effective methods to resume production. That helped make China the most stable and reliable production base in the world during the pandemic. It is because of China's determination to fight the pandemic that the world avoided a more serious challenge. The year 2020 saw China's economy expand 2.2% during the worst part of the global pandemic. That made it the only major economy in the world with positive growth. China's economic development provided a significant contribution to global economic stability.,China has continuously improved its COVID-19 response efforts. It has coordinated pandemic prevention and control measures with economic and social development, and has made important contributions to ensuring the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain while promoting the expansion of the world economy.

            ","The XBB variants of the novel coronavirus will not cause massive infections in China for now, according to a government health agency researcher.,""China discovered some imported XBB cases and 16 local cases from August to December,"" Chen Cao, a researcher at the National Institute for Viral Diseases Control and Prevention, told CGTN at a press release in Beijing on January 8. ,Chen said most of the cases were found in October, with a few local cases discovered in November and December.,""This means the XBB variants didn't gain an advantage in spreading,"" he said.,According to Chen, the antibodies in recovered COVID-19 patients will also protect them from being infected by XBB variants ""for a short time,"" although they were mostly infected by the BA.5.2 and BF.7 variants.,""The protection for a few people can last for as long as six months,"" Chen said. ""This is also a reason why XBB variants will not cause massive infections at the current stage."",As new COVID-19 variants pop up around the globe, the World Health Organization (WHO) has asked members to take protective measures like boosting the monitoring of variants. China has followed the WHO requirements and continuously monitors the spread of XBB variants.,""We have been paying close attention to XBB variants' virulence, infectivity and immune escape,"" he said. ""We will analyze the risk and propose control measures accordingly."",Chen also warned people, especially those entering China from places with high XBB variant infections, of the risk of importing the variants to China.,""We should take good care of ourselves and go to medical facilities if necessary,"" Chen said. ""We should be responsible for our own health and the health of people around us."""
Young drummer sounding the beats of China's heartland,"

    13:23, 09-Jan-2023

            ","The Ansai waist drum, a unique 1,000-year-old folk dance originating from central China, has been incorporated into local primary school curriculums, passing on this lively and historical tradition to a new generation of young drummers. ,The drum dance's origins are closely related to the historical and geographic conditions of Ansai, now a district of Yan'an in Shaanxi Province. Once called the ""throat of the region,"" it was an important military outpost and stronghold throughout Chinese history. Drums were used to warn about surprise attacks, boost soldiers' morale during confrontations and celebrate victory.,For this reason, some folk dance styles are reminiscent of military formations and require the dancers to devote their energy throughout the performance. Gao Yuchen, a local Grade 4 student, said it wasn't easy learning the drum dance at first. ,""I was not good at where to place the drum, and it left scratches on my fingers, but I wrapped them up and kept on practicing,"" he said. What drove little Yuchen was the vigor of the performance itself, to which he was drawn at first sight.,The boy dancers of the Ansai waist drum wear a white towel on their heads to represent traditional local farmers, while the girls tie their hair on each side like the horns of a goat, a vital livestock in the area. Along with the sounds of the Chinese red drum and other folk instruments, they drum and dance with leaping jumps and bountiful smiles. ,The Ansai district organizes school and district-level drum dance showcases every year, which the students, parents and teachers all look forward to. It's only the third year that Gao Yuchen has participated in the performance, and he helped his class win the first place in his year level.,Professional Ansai waist drum dancers have been part of such major events since the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, which has proved a great motivation for young learners. ""I think everyone should try our waist drum,"" Yuchen said with pride, adding that he hopes to one day perform overseas. ,For the modern-day people of Ansai, the waist drum performance symbolizes saying goodbye to the past year and welcoming the new one. Watching the performance at the beginning of the New Year lets them look forward to the auspicious months ahead. Although faced with the challenging natural conditions of the Loess Plateau, the region presents a wonderful range of folk arts to reflect people's positivity and optimism for life.,Ansai is located in the north of historic Shaanxi Province, where the Terracotta Army of the first Chinese emperor was first discovered. The region lies in the very heart of China and overlooks the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization."

The emerging 'face' of Sichuan Opera,"

    20:27, 09-Jan-2023

            ","Costumed performers breathing fire on stage or changing their masks a dozen times within the space of a single performance is a delight for audiences watching Spring Festival events for both the domestic and overseas Chinese communities. And these two stunts both have their origins in one of China's most important culture heritages: Sichuan Opera.,As the name suggests, the roots of Sichuan Opera lie in the mountainous Sichuan Province of southwest China, which is also famous for pandas and spicy food. Unlike Italian opera's emphasis on monologues and singing, Sichuan Opera involves several components that combine acrobatics, fire breathing, clown performances and so on. The most famous and mysterious component is face-changing.,It's hard to imagine beginners to Sichuan Opera start learning the art of face-changing, but 13-year-old Hu Yibo did just that. A native of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, Hu was born into a Sichuan Opera family. His grandfather was an opera singer; his dad runs a Sichuan Opera house in the downtown area and Hu himself has ""art"" in his given name.,""I basically grew up immersed in Sichuan Opera,"" claims Hu. Despite having just reached his teens, years of training and performing in front of audiences have given him a sense of maturity. He wanted to start with face-changing because it was the act that first attracted him to the world of Sichuan Opera. ,""A lot of drilling is required to become a good face-changer,"" Hu smiles as he looks back over his learning journey.,Face-changing is a unique technique where the performer switches their painted silk face masks with a sweep of hand or the turn of a head in a split second. The purpose of the different colored masks is to help convey a new emotion or a change in personality. The technique is so revered that it's not widely taught but instead preserved by opera families or passed down from master to apprentice.,Hu's face-changing skills were passed on from his grandfather. Since more than a dozen masks are changed within the space of one performance, the layers are so thick that Hu always pours with sweat inside the masks. But the audience's reaction is his motivation.,""When I was little, people saw me practicing and said one day they'd come and see me perform, so I kept on training to be able to stand on the stage,"" Hu says.,Now as a young ""old hand"" of face-changing performance, Hu has enrolled in a Sichuan Opera training college to expand his repertoire. In the classes, he is taught clown routines, singing and martial arts moves. And as this ancient art form enters the curriculum, many more young performers can not only learn Sichuan Opera, but also ensure it keeps evolving.,It took time to transform the art of Sichuan Opera into standardized classes. Su Mingde, a seasoned Sichuan Opera performer who is also Hu's teacher, spent a great deal of time preparing and recording the music for the traditional clown performances which many of the other teachers now use. Su and Hu have both won national awards for their Sichuan Opera performances.,Thanks to these old and young performers, Sichuan Opera is not only the culture signature of Sichuan, but also an art form that's gaining popularity overseas."

This is to ensure that a high degree of self-consciousness can be developed among all Party members in terms of observing Party rules and discipline.,Noting that the fight against corruption remains grave and complex, and the Party still faces uphill tasks in preventing new cases and rooting out existing ones, Xi urged enhanced efforts to address both the symptoms and root causes of the problem in a systematic way.,Coordinated steps must be taken to see that officials do not have the audacity, opportunity or desire to become corrupt, Xi said.,To keep pressure on officials so that they do not become corrupt, the deterrent effect of a zero tolerance policy and harsh punishment should be maintained, he said.,Corrupt officials who show no sign of restraint should be punished. Corruption that involves both political and economic elements should be resolutely investigated and dealt with, he said.,Action should be taken to prevent leading officials from acting for any interest group or power group, and to forestall any collusion between officials and business people, or any infiltration of capital into politics that undermines the political ecosystem or the environment for economic development, he said.,The launch of initiatives to uproot prominent sectoral, institutional and regional corruption is also imperative, Xi said.,Efforts to ensure officials do not have the opportunity to become corrupt should be intensified, Xi said, calling for advancements in oversight mechanism reform and institutional development in key areas, and for improving institutions and mechanisms to curb corruption.,More measures are needed to ensure that officials do not have the desire to become corrupt, Xi said, stressing the importance of promoting a culture of integrity in the new era.,Improving the laws and regulations targeting bribery is important, as is meting out joint punishment for those offering bribes, Xi said, vowing to crack down harshly on political liars with so-called connections.,Improving the total-coverage, authoritative and highly effective oversight system under the Party's unified leadership is essential to modernizing China's system and capacity for governance, Xi said. ,On refining this oversight system, Xi emphasized the leading role of Party committees, the continued efforts to reform the country's discipline inspection and supervision system, and the strengthened inspections that serve as a powerful tool. ,Xi noted that discipline inspection and supervision organs must remain loyal to the Party, take on tough and arduous tasks, and be adept at tackling their struggles.,He stressed the need to raise awareness of upholding the rule of law, following procedures and producing evidence, and to make discipline inspection and supervision work more well-regulated, law-based and standardized. ,Discipline inspection and supervision organs should submit themselves willingly to oversight from all sides, manage their staff in a strict manner, and punish corrupt elements in the system harshly, so as to prevent being blind to their own problems, he said.,(With input from Xinhua),(Cover: Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, addresses the second plenary session of the 20th CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection in Beijing, capital of China, January 9, 2023. /Xinhua)"

Black Mirror is just a TV series, but it also makes one reflect on what role bees play in human life.,The importance of bees in the Earth's ecosystem cannot be overstated. Bees give us honey, and they play their part either pollinating the many vegetables and fruits we eat directly or pollinating the food for the animals that we then consume.,According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, pollinators are involved in producing the food that feeds 1/3 of the world's population, and more than 85 percent of this pollination is done through honeybees. It is estimated that more than 2,500 honey bee species pollinate plants worldwide.,However, the honeybee population is declining significantly. In the future, it is likely that robots will be needed to take over the duties of bees for artificial pollination in order to preserve the diversity of vegetation.,Why are bee populations declining? For more than a decade, scientists have been searching for the cause of the decline in bee colonies. Since it is difficult to obtain samples of the disappearing worker bees, there is no definite conclusion so far.,However, several experts say that there are natural factors behind the decline, such as the invasion of various parasites and pathogens, as well as human factors, such as chemical pesticides, industrial pollution, destruction of bee habitats, and the potential interference of increased cellular communication facilities with the bees' ability to navigate.,According to a recent study by Anthony Nearman and Dennis vanEngelsdorp, the average lifespan of worker bees was 34.3 days 50 years ago and is now only 17.7 days.,(All images via VCG)"

            ","China has officially downgraded COVID-19 from Class A infectious disease to Class B since January 8, which signals that China's COVID-19 response has entered a new phase.,This raised questions about the current and future situation of COVID-19 control. Experts from government agencies talked with China Media Group (CMG) to explain the next steps of the country's management of the disease.,The worst is passing or has already passed for major cities in China, according to Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission (NHC).,""In large cities, the pressure on emergency department of hospitals is easing,"" she said. ""But there's a high number of severe cases being treated."",Small- and medium-sized cities and rural areas are likely to experience a peak of emergency and severe cases during the Spring Festival travel rush, she added.,Generally, Jiao told CMG she doesn't expect another peak of infection after the festival, but medical facilities should get ready for a possible peak of severe cases.,About eight percent of all Omicron cases in 2022 were classed as moderate cases with symptoms of pneumonia, Jiao said.,""The percentage seems small,"" she said. ""But that's still a large group of people as China has a huge population."",Apart from treating the COVID-19 patients, the Chinese government also released a new epidemic surveillance plan, using data from hospitals, testing facilities and sentinel surveillance sites to track and evaluate the progress of the epidemic.,""We can research the incidence, intensity, trend and timing of the epidemic, and evaluate the effectiveness of our control measures,"" said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).,So far, China has set up more than 500 sentinel surveillance sites across the country.,Wu said the CDC also monitored key institutions like nursing homes as well as respiratory symptoms in school students.,As the disease was downgraded, the government now requires less prevention and control measures according to law.,With that said, downgrading is ""definitely not laissez-faire,"" Liang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 response expert panel under the NHC, told CMG.,The law still requires stipulated prevention and control measures, including reporting cases, management and treatment of patients, and necessary public health and social interventions and monitoring, according to Liang.,For such a major infectious disease, the government cannot deal with it alone, Liang said, calling for joint efforts by all parties.,""Of course, while the government is taking the leading role, everyone still must do their job,"" he said.,(Cover: Doctors check on a patient in a hospital in Dongguan City, south China's Guangdong Province, January 6, 2023. /CFP)"

Study reveals grasslands biodiversity help control plant diseases,"

            ","Chinese researchers have newly confirmed the significance of spatial scale-dependent dilution effects of biodiversity on plant diseases in grasslands, according to the Lanzhou University. The results of the study have been published in the journal Ecology.,The new study suggested that spatial scale plays an important role in predicting infectious diseases of plants, said Liu Xiang, a researcher from the College of Ecology under Lanzhou University and the leader of the study.,Suffering from rapid biodiversity losses, it is of both theoretical and practical significance to better understand the relationship between biodiversity and plant infectious diseases. The study team tested how spatial scale affects the direction and magnitude of the biodiversity-disease relationship.,The researchers utilized a long-term nitrogen addition experiment conducted in an alpine meadow in northwest China's Gansu Province, and tested how the sample area was affected by the relationship between plant species richness and foliar fungal disease severity.,The findings indicated that the dilution effect was more easily observed in a small area. The study could help explain the observed variation in the biodiversity-disease relationship in grasslands, said Liu.,Therefore, the spatial information should be valued in this framework for predicting infectious diseases under rapid biodiversity loss scenarios, Liu added.,The ""dilution effect"" implies that where species vary in susceptibility to bacteria or virus which could cause disease, higher diversity often leads to lower infection prevalence in hosts.,(Cover image via CFP)"

China's COVID-19 fight in numbers: China's economy showing resilience amid global headwinds,"

    17:41, 10-Jan-2023

            ","China's economy has secured positive growth against all the odds over the past three years thanks to a slew of pro-growth measures to weather COVID-19, and its GDP is expected to exceed 120 trillion yuan (about $18 trillion) in 2022, showing strong resilience amid global headwinds.,The economy saw a V-shaped recovery between 2019 and 2021. In 2020, China was the only major economy to achieve positive growth. In 2021, its GDP contributed over 30 percent to world economic growth. In 2022, the economy remained the second largest in the world.,The country's inflation rate has remained generally stable during the COVID-19 pandemic despite bulk commodity price hikes in the international market.,China's inflation rate was 0.9 percent in 2021, and is expected to remain relatively subdued at 2.2 percent in 2022, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In contrast, global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.8 percent in 2022, IMF said in October.,China's central bank is the only of its kind in the world that is not hiking interest rates aggressively to curb inflation, according to Jean Chia, chief investment officer at Bank of Singapore.,With a solid industrial foundation and a series of policies to ensure supply, China's foreign trade in goods has maintained a relatively high growth in the past three years, which has effectively alleviated the pressure on the global supply chain arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.,China has become the major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions. The country's foreign trade in goods ranks first in the world. In 2021, its foreign trade volume surpassed the $6 trillion mark for the first time.,The country has also become a safe haven for foreign investors and is leading the world in foreign capital inflows. Its capital inflows continue to grow steadily amid the COVID-19 pandemic despite the global gloomy investor sentiment.,Global foreign direct investment (FDI) shrank by 42 percent in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while FDI inflow into China achieved a 4.5-percent growth against the downward trend. ,China has continuously cut taxes and fees to ease the burden on businesses to stabilize the economy. In 2022, about 2.4 trillion yuan worth of value-added tax credits were refunded to taxpayers' accounts, which was the largest refund in history.,Thanks to supportive tax and fee policies adopted by the government, over 80 percent of the country's privately or individually-owned businesses do not need to pay taxes, and the average tax paid monthly by eligible businesses in 2022 is 40 percent lower than that of 2019.,China's top leaders have pledged unwavering support for the private sector, as the fast-growing private sector has played a big role in creating new jobs, promoting technological innovations and stabilizing economic growth.,The private economy has continued to see strong growth despite challenges posed by COVID-19. From January 2020 to August 2022, the number of Chinese private enterprises expanded from 35.2 million to 47.0 million. In 2021, they accounted for 92.1 percent of all enterprises.,In 2021, the private sector contributed 48.6 percent of foreign trade, 56.5 percent of fixed-asset investment, 59.6 percent of tax revenue, over 60 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of technological innovations and more than 80 percent of urban employment.,As the risks of global economic stagflation and recession are rising in 2023, headwinds are obvious for China.

            ","Over the past three years, China has initiated a series of major assistance measures focusing on public health, sustainable development, food security, debt reduction to help developing countries cope with the COVID-19 pandemic and resume economic and social development.,For the past three years, China has actively advocated international cooperation in the fight against COVID-19. It also has provided assistance to the international community in various ways within its capacity, including donating medical supplies, sending medical experts and sharing pandemic prevention and control experiences.,China was the first country to pledge to make COVID-19 vaccines a global public good. It was also the first to support intellectual property rights exemptions for vaccine research and development and the first to cooperate with developing countries in vaccine production. China was the largest supplier of vaccines to other countries.,A 2022 report on international cooperation in China's COVID-19 vaccine industry released by the 21st Century New Health Research Institute showed that the country has supplied more than 2.2 billion vaccine doses to more than 120 countries and international organizations. China has also carried out joint research and development and production of COVID-19 vaccines with developing countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. China has provided massive amounts of medical supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, and sent medical teams to 34 countries. China's efforts have played a key role in addressing the global shortage of the COVID-19 vaccine and added confidence and strength to the fight against the virus in developing regions.,Due to the impact of COVID-19, extreme weather, loose monetary policies of major developed economies and other factors, international food prices remain high. Many low-income countries are trapped in the dilemma of ""unaffordable food"". The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the extreme sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the West on Russia have additionally impacted the global food industry chain and supply chain.,In 2020, despite the severe impact of the pandemic on international trade, China exported 3.54 million tons of grain to help alleviate the global food shortage to some extent. In 2021, China advanced the Global Development Initiative, making food security one of the eight key areas of cooperation. China also helped promote agricultural development in developing countries through emergency food donations, technical assistance and agricultural investment. China has conducted agricultural science and technology exchanges with over 140 countries and regions. It has also introduced more than 1,000 agricultural technologies to developing countries. That effort has resulted in an average 30-60% increase in crop production in project areas.,China has also taken an active part in the United Nations World Food Program, which has established a global humanitarian emergency warehouse and hub in the country. On the WTO platform, China has called for open food trade, and urged the lifting of unilateral sanctions and maintained the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains. It also has provided a fair and reasonable international trade environment for agricultural improvements in developing countries.,Developing countries have been plagued by debt in recent years, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic additionally exacerbated their liquidity and solvency problems. In response to the crisis, China supported the postponement of debt repayment under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative  by the G20, and reached agreements with many countries to defer or reschedule debt repayment, with a negotiated amount of $10.8 billion, much higher than that of other countries.,China has also helped developing countries overcome the economic, financial and public health pressures brought about by the pandemic through multilateral platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB created a COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility in 2020 to support members and clients in alleviating and mitigating economic, financial and public health pressures arising from COVID-19. The effort has benefitted 12 countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Georgia, with a total value of over 5.9 billion U.S. dollars.,In general, over the past three years, China has conducted the most intensive and wide-ranging emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It has made positive contributions to the world's response to the pandemic. In addition, China has advanced the growth of global development while demonstrating the responsibilities of being the world's largest developing country."

The measures are being improved all the time, and we always work proactively,"" Liang said, adding that the winter announcements of new, relaxed management measures are the result of all-around consideration.,Experts at the meeting also said vaccination remains the best line of defense, as the country is currently ramping up new vaccination campaigns for vulnerable groups, especially medical staff and the elderly."

            ","The chief executive officer (CEO) of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) is bullish about the sector's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and expects exponential growth over the next decade mainly thanks to a boost from Chinese outbound travelers and foreign visitors to China.,""I have been there (China) many times ... and it's wonderful that the world would be able to open its arms and welcome Chinese visitors again,"" said Julia Simpson, president and CEO of the WTTC.,In early December 2022, China decided to optimize its COVID-19 response with new prevention and control measures to ease the restrictions on travel and visits to public venues. Then, on January 8, the Civil Aviation Administration of China relaxed certain COVID-19 restrictions on international passenger flights.,""Before the pandemic, travel and tourism used to represent one in 10 jobs globally and one in $10 that were made globally.

But the good news is that travel and tourism are going to bounce back and will grow over the next 10 years almost double the rate of global gross domestic product (GDP),"" she said.,As a non-profit organization, WTTC's members include over 200 CEOs, chairpersons and presidents of the world's leading private sector travel and tourism businesses.,Simpson said that after nearly three years, the phenomenon of ""revenge travel,"" which means traveling to make up for lost time during the pandemic, is expected to lift tourism and boost businesses.,""What we tend to see when people reopen their borders post-pandemic is that you have a lot of pent-up demand for travel.

TCM continues to play significant role in treating COVID-19,"

            ","Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been playing an important role in China's fight against COVID-19. ,As China is shifting the focus of its COVID-19 response from preventing infections to protecting people's health and preventing severe cases, the unique strength of TCM is further leveraged by health authorities to protect the life and health of the people. ,On January 5, China issued the 10th version of diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19, which fully reflects the valuable experience of using TCM in the treatment of severe and critical cases. The new protocol introduces targeted TCM treatments for severe cases, and puts forward relatively complete therapeutic TCM solutions for children. ,The country has also developed a unique plan to treat COVID-19 epidemic by combining the use of both TCM and Western medicine for severe and critical patients. ,Currently, the importance of TCM in the battle against coronavirus is mainly reflected in three aspects. ,""First, intervention can be stratified for patients,"" Huang Luqi, deputy head of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said on January 4 at a press conference. ""Patients can choose proper TCM for home treatment to reduce the overloading risk and pressure on medical institutions and resources."",Second, patients with mild and ordinary symptoms can depend on TCM as the leading treatment, Huang noted.,Third, TCM plays a part in recovery. After nucleic acid turns negative, many patients still undergo cough, fatigue, sweating and other symptoms.,""TCM can treat those symptoms and exert its function in overall regulation of the body as a whole,"" Huang said.,China has been putting more and more effort to help patients in rural areas with TCM.,In Daming County, Handan City of north China's Hebei Province, doctors are going to rural sites, providing free consultations and diagnosis to elderly villagers, and distributing free medicines, most of which are TCM and mixtures.,""I've got medicine here twice, and after taking the medicine, my family members are feeling better,"" said resident Wang Aijiao.,""Our hospital and the fellow hospitals are sending doctors to villages twice a week,"" said Yang Chenjuan, a doctor from the Daming Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,""We also provide them with free Chinese herbal medicines, herbs for foot baths and TCM fumigations, as well as offer more health advice,"" Yang said.,TCM companies across the country are using advanced manufacturing processes to ensure adequate output of medicines, and refining and improving TCM theories and practices to contain diseases. ,The production lines of pharmaceuticals company Zhendong Group are running 24 hours a day to make the medicine products for prevention of COVID-19. ,""We have invested more in production of proprietary Chinese medicines with modern concepts, from the cultivation and storage of Chinese herbs to product development. This is an opportunity for us to give back to society,"" said Li Anping, president of of the company.,TCM therapy still offers effective treatment against new COVID-19 variants. ,""Current variants are all causing upper respiratory infections,"" said Liu Qingquan, president of Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, at a press conference on Monday, adding that the new variants spreading in other countries such as BQ.1 or XBB are not fundamentally different from the BA.5.2 and BF.7 which have been predominantly circulating in China. ,""Our TCM therapy still works,"" Liu said."

How a Chinese travel-tech startup survived the pandemic,"

    19:26, 11-Jan-2023

            ","After enduring three consecutive hard winters, the long-awaited spring is finally arriving for China's tourism sector as the country lifts most of its mobility curbs. The entire travel sector and its practitioners have struggled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large majority reportedly leaving the business entirely, but some persevered and found breakthroughs.,One of the entrepreneurs who did not give up on the travel industry was Cheng Xiaoyu, founder of Lushu Technology Co., a company providing tailor-made journey plans to travel agencies. The company's focus had been on overseas tour plans, but demand collapsed when the virus struck the world.,Adapting to the new reality of the pandemic, Lushu turned to the domestic Chinese market. Cheng made several attempts to carry on her business, including launching luxury train rides in northwest China and building a metaverse in central Shanghai.,Along with partners, the company put out a 12-day trip on the New Orient Express which starts from Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and sits on the route of the ancient Silk Road. Equipped with private shower rooms and queen-size beds, the carriage looks just like a leveled-up version of the iconic luxury train as portrayed in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. Passengers will visit nature and cultural heritage along the trip.,However, rolling out the project was far from a smooth ride due to pandemic disruptions. The trip only proceeded twice in 2021 despite five being planned, and three out of four trips were canceled in 2022.,The outcome was very discouraging for organizers who invested considerable time and money beforehand. On the national level, many left the travel sector after similar setbacks.,A China Chamber of Tourism survey in early 2022 found that nearly 70 percent of travel sector practitioners in the country left the industry due to the pandemic.,""Who is willing to invest in good quality travel products when [they are] losing money every time?"" Cheng told CGTN in frustration.,The most painful time in these years came from seeing the same people who were once the most ambitious in the industry having their spirits dashed, she said.,""Rebuilding confidence is a long process,"" Cheng added.,Resilience is revealed when people decide not to give in to uncertainties and challenges. And Cheng switched her focus to building experiences based on a single spot after retreating from planning long-distance trips and tours.,She set up a new company with some partners in 2020, building a platform dedicated to the innovation of content and the creation of intellectual property based on several unique destinations. They aimed to replicate the Disney model, which is a place people revisit and have stars like Lina Bell, generate sustainable revenue. Lina Bell is Disney's hottest hit, a pink fox character developed by Shanghai Disney Resort.,Customers expect novel experiences from a trip. The old practice of tour guides navigating at a destination using anecdotes is less appealing when people get similar content from Douyin every day, said Cheng. Douyin is the Chinese version of TikTok. ,Providing an immersive, story-based experience to customers is the way forward in the sector, she added.,That was why the company built a metaverse-themed ""Metacity"" in central Shanghai where customers can find experiences that may have some similarities to sci-fi movies such as Ready Player One and The Wandering Earth.,The projects benefit from Shanghai City's plan for metaverse development and urban revival. The site is built on a national cultural relic protection site with over 90 years of history and also received technological assistance from district authorities.,Shanghai is working to inject vitality into older parts of the city. It is also supporting technologies to build a virtual world and targets to grow its metaverse industry to 350 billion yuan ($51.7 billion) in value by 2025.,Cheng said she empathizes with the ""lying flat"" mentality among young people, a buzzword that trended on Chinese social media last year. The attitude refers to just doing enough to get by.,Young people are full of creativity and curiosity but the pandemic suppressed their willingness to explore the world, she explained. Young people's will to search for poetry and the far afield is alive, but their enthusiasms may need a spark to ignite.,""If they don't bathe in the sun, they'll defiantly suffer deficiency in calcium,"" said Cheng.,Cheng suggested the introduction of a Youth Card, offering a discount on tickets for trains, museums, or shows to people in China under the age of 30 as a way to put money back into people's pockets to spur spending. ,A similar scheme has been used in countries like France and the UK to sell train tickets at two-third of the normal price to young adults.,China has set boosting consumer confidence and increasing consumption as the priorities of economic growth in 2023. The country has put out an array of , to support that. Moreover, its top banking and insurance regulator pledged to increase , for the catering and tourism industry this year.,, scrapping mass testing and quarantine requirements. Cheng predicted that overseas travel and domestic scene-based travel will boom together when pent-up demand is released.,China was the largest spender on global tourism before the pandemic and tourist hot spots are anticipating their return. Tourism authorities worldwide have recently been , and putting up advertisements in Chinese subway stations.,The Thai deputy prime minister even welcomed Chinese tourists at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport in person on January 9. Thailand estimate that it would receive 10 million Chinese visitors this year, closing in on the pre-pandemic level at 11 million., ,Cheng expects an overall revival in the market will not arrive till May as people stayed put until overseas public health and supporting policies towards Chinese tourists become clearer. Lingering infections and surging costs resulting from a shattered travel supply chain also discourage travel in the near term.,The way forward may be bumpy for tourism in 2023, but with hopeful stories like Cheng's, the outlook right now sure is brightening."

Verse on stage: Chinese actor illustrates charm of 'poetic' masterpiece ,"

    14:19, 12-Jan-2023

            ","Having lived in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) during the ""Golden Age of Chinese Poetry,"" Li Bai (701-762) was a poetic genius, acclaimed from his own time to the present as a brilliant and romantic figure who used his literary talent to take Chinese poetry to new heights. He traveled to many mountains and rivers throughout the country, engaging in a spiritual journey while embracing the diversity of life. ,Artists of subsequent dynasties created numerous works to commemorate Li Bai and his poems, including the painting ""Li Bai in Stroll"" by Liang Kai from the Southern Song Dynasty. Although Liang used simple brushstrokes and light colors to portray Li Bai, the ethereal and other-worldly quality of his poetic genius was well exhibited. ,Produced by China Media Group, the cultural program ""China in Poetry and Painting"" invited the renowned actor Wang Luoyong to play the role of Li Bai, reanimating the scene depicted in his masterpiece.,""Li Bai in Stroll"" is a traditional Chinese ink painting by Liang Kai of the Southern Song Dynasty that is now housed at the Tokyo National Museum. In this masterpiece, the figure of the poet occupies the lower two-thirds of the painting. He is shown standing sideways wearing a robe, and seemingly in wooden clogs. His head tilts slightly upwards, as though he were gazing at the empty expanse above as well as the moon and the clouds. ,Although the strokes seem economical and simple at first glance, a deeper look reveals their subtle grace and profundity. With precise control of brush and ink, Liang captured the very essence of Li Bai. His facial features — forehead, nose, eyebrow, eye, lips and jawline — were depicted with delicate strokes. ,The poet is shown slightly wrinkling his brows, with a jet-black dot conveying the distant gaze of his observant eyes. His lips are slightly parted, prefiguring the formation of his poems. The outline of the figure and clothing are painted with broad strokes in an unrestrained style. ,Meanwhile, his shoes are presented with a few vague blobs of ink, conveying a sense of motion. Liang employed bold yet free brushwork to create a painting that was ahead of its time, capturing the unpretentious personality and laid-back aspect of the poet Li Bai as he ambles along, reciting some verses, creating an artistic effect in which the lines are reduced yet the spirit remains undiminished.,According to Kang Zhen, the vice-principal of Beijing Normal University, in order to create heirlooms such as this, one must have a profound insight into the object depicted. In ""Li Bai in Scroll,"" Liang used thinned ink to describe the robed figure in profile, gently striding forward with his hands clasped behind his back while set against a blank background. ,The well-designed contrast of the painting's spatial layout is thought-provoking. By highlighting the only character in the painting, Liang foregrounds the spiritual goals jointly by both himself and Li Bai — an unruly and unrestrained personality —in this masterpiece.,Hundreds of years later, contemporary artists continue to interpret the painting's charm in new ways. On the stage of ""China in Poetry and Painting,"" the actor Wang Luoyong, being cast as the protagonist, presents an audio-visual feast for spectators. ,With folk singing in the background, Wang recites his poems while walking through some virtual mountains, rivers and cities. The performance shows Li Bai's extraordinary imagination, fully endowed with vitality and enthusiasm. Despite having been hit by reality, he refuses to give up and keeps chasing his lofty dreams.,Li Bai's poems embody his sense of romance, chivalry, heroism, and freedom while traveling around the mountains and rivers of China. Many people who appreciate his poetry also respect the spirit that he conveyed, as reflected in ""Li Bai in Scroll."",Li Bai has left an artistic legacy for Chinese literature to build on, allowing generations of Chinese to feel that same sense of freedom as they relive the spiritual journeys he embarked on."

Others like the UK, Australia, Canada, France and the U.S. are requiring a negative COVID test for travelers from China.,While countries like Japan and South Korea took more stringent actions.,South Korea announced last week a pause on issuing tourist visas for those coming from China. Social media posts show Chinese in South Korea given yellow cards to hang around their necks upon arrival. Japan is limiting flights from China to some Japanese cities and also requiring a negative COVID test for travelers from China.,China in return found the move to be discriminatory.,“A handful of countries, in disregard of science, facts and their actual epidemic situation, have insisted on taking discriminatory entry restriction measures targeting China.

The atoms of carbon can bond together in multiple ways, resulting in various forms of carbon, such as graphite, diamond and amorphous carbon, which have been used in various fields.,New carbon materials including fullerene, carbon nanotube and graphene have been discovered successively and attracted people's attention.,To prepare such new carbon materials, researchers in the past either used extreme conditions such as high temperature and high pressure or microscopic processing technologies such as ultraviolet light and electron beam irradiation. It resulted in low yield and impure products and prevented people from exploring the properties and applications of such materials.,Zhu Yanwu, a researcher at the USTC, who led the team, heated C60 fullerene with lithium nitride to moderate temperatures and formed the polymerized C60 crystal forms and the LOPC.,Further study showed that the LOPC is a ""metastable structure produced during the transformation from fullerene-type to graphene-type carbons."",The LOPC – microscopically porous but completely retains the macroscopic periodicity of crystals – may have potential applications in energy storage, ion screening, load catalysis and other fields in the future, Zhu said.,""The charge injection technology used in this study is expected to be a new way to regulate crystal structure with atomic-level precision,"" Zhu added.,The study was published in the journal ,on Wednesday.,The reviewers said the results are compelling and is of great importance to the fields of crystallography and materials science, according to a report issued in the Chinese newspaper ,."

Renowned artist Huang Yongyu designs Year of the Rabbit stamps,"

    17:01, 12-Jan-2023

            ","As the artist who designed the first zodiac stamp in China, 99-year-old Huang Yongyu has made headlines again by creating stamps for the upcoming Year of the Rabbit. Creative, humorous, and conveying a sense of happiness, the new stamp series reflects the consistent artistic style of the renowned artist. And just like the much sought-after monkey stamp he created in 1980, the newly-released rabbit stamps attracted many collectors waiting in long queues.,In the new stamp series, the first stamp features a blue rabbit with a pen and paper writing New Year blessings to people everywhere. It toys with the wordplay between the terms for ""blue rabbit"" and ""blueprint,"" which sound similar in Chinese, with ""blueprint"" representing a bright future and good fortune.,The second stamp, depicting three rabbits chasing each other from head to tail, conveys a sense of vitality. If you look closely, there is a jade rabbit pounding medicine in the background, representing wishes of good health and happiness for people.,The rabbit is the fourth animal in the Chinese zodiac calendar and represents beauty, peace, prosperity, and harvest. Huang said he designed the stamps this way to convey a sense of happiness over Lunar New Year celebrations. ""Painting the rabbit stamps is a happy thing,"" he added.,""What comes to mind is that the first rabbit is not like a regular, gentle one. It suggests a sense of naughtiness, naivety, and a unique soul. I think it has something to do with Mr. Huang Yongyu's understanding of the zodiac,"" said Wang Jing, executive editor of the Year of the Rabbit stamps. She added that these latest works are consistent with the creative and humorous approach seen throughout Huang's career.,This unique creation style can also be seen when Huang Yongyu designed zodiac stamps featuring monkeys back in 1980 and 2016. As he recalled, he picked up a pen, got an idea and used his sense of humor to complete the creation of the monkey with some improvisation. A sense of joy and festivity has always been at the heart of what Huang seeks to convey to his audience.,That is Huang Yongyu, his creations are humorous but also deep in meaning. With his artistic career spanning decades, Huang has always managed to convey the deeper meaning of life in a light and natural way.,Huang Yongyu was born in central China's Hunan Province in 1924. He left his hometown of Fenghuang County while still in his teens, and traveled around China. His woodcut prints, color ink paintings and literary works brim with his passion for, and profound insights into, people from various groups and walks of life and the spirit of the times.,In addition, the veteran artist loves animals very much. Various kinds of animals are featured in his artworks. He once said of all the animals he has painted, rats inspire him the most.,""Rats always feel content and never starve to death. When being chased, they will hide or run away. It is unlucky if it comes across a cat. But if not, its life is good,"" Huang Yongyu explained humorously.,Back in 2017, Huang's paintings of the Chinese zodiac animals were exhibited at the National Museum of China in Beijing. All the animals appear lively, offering witty monologues or engaging dialogues that highlight their individual personalities. Viewers can easily sense the ""forever young"" mentality in Huang's work.,The weight of time is acknowledged, but told in an easy way. Today, at the age of almost 100, Huang Yongyu is still passionate about life and never ceases to create or explore new ideas."

Mike Gallagher will be the chair of the China committee. “China is the only country with the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” Gallagher said on the House floor Tuesday, quoting remarks from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.,In a new Congress that has so far been marked by Republican infighting and Democratic resistance, McCarthy's bipartisan win highlighted how the China-as-competitor-to-U.S. stance became a topic that could bring some lawmakers together. The situation was also evident during the last presidential race when both U.S. President Joe Biden and then-President Trump campaigned on promises to take a tough stance on China.,Among 65 lawmakers who opposed the China Select Committee on Tuesday, Judy Chu, the Representative of California and the chairwoman of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, raised concerns about the committee’s potential to fuel xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans.,Representative James McGovern of Massachusetts, who voted to approve the proposed committee, also expressed worries that the China Selected Committee would focus excessively on the ideological competition. "

How time banking programs enrich elderly care choices in China,"

    19:25, 12-Jan-2023

            ","For some older residents in Nanjing City, east China's Jiangsu Province, getting access to elderly care services can be as simple as placing orders with a few taps on the phone.,Through the time bank function on the app of My Nanjing, volunteers take orders and provide nearly 30 kinds of visiting services ranging from a haircut and food delivery to dental care or psychological therapy.,When a service is delivered, instead of money, what volunteers earn are ""time coins"" that can be used to redeem similar assistance in the future. The number of coins they receive depends on how many hours they spend performing these tasks.,Shi Xiulian, director of the time bank fund management committee of China Aging Development Foundation, leads the team that created the time bank platform in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province.,""It started with a simple wish of helping out some elderly in our community in 2013,"" said Shi, who is also a college teacher.,Shi told CGTN that she never expected the pilot project to one day evolve into a national mutual-assistance platform with tens of thousands of volunteers.,Since its launch in 2019, over 60,000 volunteers have joined Nanjing's program, striving to build a more elderly-friendly city. This means a lot to a city whose average life expectancy exceeded 80 in 2021.,Every day, thousands of elderly people place orders on the platform. As of December 2022, more than 650,000 orders have been completed.,Shi attributed the program's success to the support of multiple departments of the Nanjing government. With the support of government policies, the program has gained the trust of citizens, Shi said, adding that over 11 percent of the platform's volunteers are aged 60 and above.,""The proportion of elderly volunteers is small because most of them still shoulder traditional responsibilities in the family, such as looking after grandchildren,"" said Shi. ""But they are the most active group among all volunteers."",Like Nanjing, populations in most Chinese cities are getting older. Today, one in seven Chinese is over 65. As the elderly population in the country continues to grow, more caregivers are needed. To help relieve the burden of elderly care, many places are piloting similar time banking programs.,Professor Chen Gong, director of the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told CGTN that time banking can be used to activate social participation in dealing with an aging population.,Chen's team has been following the development of time banking in China and did in-depth research on time banks in 20 provinces in 2021.,Regional differences in the level of development and the degree of aging call for different types of time banks, Chen said.,The idea of time banking was put forward by American scholar Edgar Cahn in 1980. In the past 40 years, the model has been implemented in over 30 countries, especially those with a large aging population, such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.,The idea emerged in China around 2000, and cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing and Guangzhou were among the first batch to pilot the model in communities. But it is only in the last few years that it has seen rapid growth with support from local governments.,Last June, Beijing launched a city-level time bank program for elderly care services. After being trained, every citizen older than 18 can earn one coin for every hour they spend caring for an older person. They can either redeem these when they turn 60, or give them to older family members. People who save 10,000 coins could have a spot in a state-run care home.,According to the China Time Bank Blue Book 2022, released last November, the government-led model has been explored in more cities across China, such as the northwestern city of Xi'an and eastern cities of Qingdao and Wuxi. Over 300,000 people have applied to join these programs.,As China's birthrate continues to decrease in recent years, there are concerns about the sustainability of this cycle of goodwill.,""It needs time to tell whether a model is sustainable,"" Professor Chen said. ""The development of the time bank in our country is still in its infancy, and we will keep observing its changes and characteristics."",To achieve the ideal goal of building a nationwide platform that allows everyone to deposit and withdraw their time currency, solving the credit issue of time banks is important, Chen said.,Chen said local governments could learn from each other and optimize their own time banking system according to their needs and local conditions.,Having over 50 universities and colleges, Nanjing has turned to the potential of students.,Shi's team created positions especially for college students, turning the time bank platform into a community where young people could put what they've learned into practice. At present, young people account for the biggest proportion, over 40 percent, of Nanjing time bank's volunteers.,Recently, volunteers can also place orders on the platform, displaying the skills and services they offer. The elderly can choose whether to accept the new services according to their needs.,""The platform promotes communication between generations and helps create a harmonious social atmosphere,"" said Shi. ""Perhaps it could also prepare talents for the elderly care industry."""

He also chaired a symposium on the same day.,During his inspection, he learned at the intellectual property office that the average time taken by the patent review process has been cut by one-third compared with five years ago. He said innovation is vital in market competition, and protecting intellectual property is to protect innovation, so efforts must be made to provide government services with higher quality and efficiency to accelerate the application and transformation of innovation and promote industry upgrade.,At a data analysis center of the SAMR, officials said that China's market entities have increased in number from 55 million 10 years ago to 169 million now, while there are more than 110 million self-employed individuals. Li stressed that market entities play important roles in securing employment and maintaining the stable operation of the economy, so officials should deepen reforms and make more preferential policies to nurture and foster market entities.,To better coordinate COVID-19 management with economic and social development, the government should pay attention to the recovery of market entities, especially the micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as self-employed individuals, which are facing difficulties and some new problems due to the COVID-19 impacts, Li said.,To solve their problem, Li emphasized efforts to maintain policy stability and continue implementing the previously-introduced package of policies to stabilize the economy, including cutting taxes and administrative fees, promoting major project constructions supported by financial instruments, and supporting the sustainable development of the platform economy.,He also called to quickly respond to the concerns of market entities, help them with problems relating to labor force, credit funds, raw material supplies and other issues, protect the property rights of various enterprises and boost the confidence of private enterprises so that a quick resumption of work and production after the Spring Festival holiday can be achieved."

Many Chinese people will travel to reunite with their families for the Chinese Lunar New Year, which falls on January 22 this year.,According to,, vice minister of transport, the number of passenger trips during this year's Spring Festival travel rush is expected to surge 99.5 percent from the same period last year to reach nearly 2.1 billion.,""This year's Spring Festival travel rush will see an obvious increase in travelers compared to the previous two years. Therefore, transport authorities in China have been improving their services and promoting technologies such as online ticket purchase, electronic tickets, and facial check-in, to guarantee people's safety and make trips easier during this period,"" said Ma Minshu, associate professor at Beijing Jiaotong University.,For travelers waiting for departure, it is common to have a meal in a restaurant at the railway station. But the intelligent restaurant at east China's Jinan Railway Station has brought a brand new experience for travelers.,Unlike traditional restaurants, the Gaotiexia intelligent restaurant has no human servers or chefs but is operated by robotic equipment.,""We have six automatic cooking devices. Each dish takes only 5 minutes from being ordered to being delivered at the table,"" said Ren Guotao, who is in charge of the restaurant.,The devices are able to cook 18 kinds of dishes for customers, including stir-fried shrimp with cashew nuts, braised chicken with mushroom, and the traditional Sichuan cuisine dish spicy Mapo tofu.,The restaurant is also equipped with a smart coffee machine, soymilk and beverage machine, and ice cream machine.

            ","Through science-based adjustments to its COVID-19 response policies, China has won wide acclaim from scholars both at home and abroad.,Lawrence Loh, director of the Center for Governance and Sustainability at the National University of Singapore, said that China's epidemic prevention measures are well-calibrated and are poised to lead China into the next era of development and advancement.,China has made an array of active adjustments in its COVID-19 response, including announcing 20 measures in November and 10 new measures in December 2022, and changing the Chinese term for COVID-19 from ""novel coronavirus pneumonia"" to ""novel coronavirus infection."",Since January 8, 2023, China has been managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B infectious diseases, instead of Class A infectious diseases.,Speaking of the attitude of certain Western countries toward the Chinese mainland's epidemic response policies, Jieh Wen-chieh, a commentator from China's Taiwan region, pointed out in a television interview that the Western criticism is motivated by the intention of sowing trouble in China.,Jieh said that the Chinese mainland has been adhering to the principle of science-based epidemic control.,Considering its population, said Jieh, the Chinese mainland's performance in COVID-19 response is the best in the world. ""You will come to this conclusion if you look at the statistics (of the countries) with better resources, more advanced medical technologies and smaller populations,"" Jieh said.,Jieh expressed his disappointment at reports by certain Western media outlets.,""When the Chinese mainland's science-based epidemic prevention and control measures were stringent, Western media outlets rallied together to criticize them,"" Jieh said. Now, he pointed out, those media outlets are doing the same thing with the measures being optimized. ""It is very weird,"" he added.,In Jieh's opinion, the recent restrictions imposed by some Western countries targeting only Chinese tourists are unnecessary. ""They harbor malicious intentions from the very beginning,"" Jieh said. ""Certain Western countries only want to believe that the Chinese mainland is doing a worse job on COVID-19 response than them."",In a period of about three years, China was able to dodge the havoc of the more deadly Delta variant and other variants, reducing its rates of severe cases and mortality, and protecting people's lives and health to the greatest extent possible.,John Ross, a British scholar, spoke highly of China's endeavors in saving lives during the epidemic.,In a recent column, Ross, who is currently a senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies of the Renmin University of China and a former director of economic and business policy for the mayor of London, noted that the average life expectancy of Chinese people in 2021, which is 78.2 years, is significantly higher than the 76.4 years of people in the United States.,Ross said that China has vastly outperformed the West, not only in terms of saving lives but also in terms of economic results, with the facts showing that China's economy has slowed but still boasted a much better performance than the West. In particular, China has escaped the severe stagflationary crisis that struck the United States and the European Union.,""China's performance in both health and economy during the pandemic is in international comparative terms little short of a miracle -- above all in comparison to the Western countries,"" Ross penned.,China's average annual economic growth rate over the past three years was approximately 4.5 percent, higher than the global average and making an important contribution to global economic growth.,Today, the COVID-19 situation in the world's second-largest economy is improving and some provinces and cities have already passed their infection peaks, and life and work are returning to normal at an accelerated pace.,Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, said the Chinese economy will likely witness a robust recovery and upward trajectory, benefiting many countries across the globe."

            ","With a human body and a rabbit's ears and mouth, Lord Rabbit, known as Tu'er Ye in Chinese, is considered an amazing symbol of Beijing local culture.  ,The earliest records of the Lord Rabbit date back to the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), once used for worship on Mid-Autumn Day. During the Qing Dynasty, Lord Rabbit served as both a shrine and a toy for children. In the hands of modern artists, Lord Rabbit can now take on any shape and be decorated with any design.,In the iconic image, Lord Rabbit often appears in a warrior's armor, with banners on its back and holds a pestle, a tool for pounding medicine.,With the Year of the Rabbit just around the corner, come and follow the most famous rabbit in Beijing city and enjoy the beauty of the capital.,The Beijing Central Axis is 7.8 kilometers in length, starting from the Yongding Gate in the south of the city and ending with the Drum Tower and Bell Tower in the north. Most of the major old-city buildings of Beijing are along this axis. The central axis is like the backbone of Beijing, representing the highest achievement in the planning, design and construction of an ancient capital of Eastern civilization.,Located in downtown Beijing, Beihai Park is one of the oldest and best-preserved imperial gardens in China. First built in the 11th century, it is among the largest of all Chinese gardens and contains numerous historically important structures, palaces and temples. Since 1925, the place has been open to the public as a park.,The White Stupa of the Miaoying Temple was completed during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) and was designed by Nepalese architect Araniko (1245-1306) and is the only well-preserved cultural relic of the Dadu capital of the Yuan Dynasty in Beijing. The main body of the White Stupa resembles a giant inverted bowl. At the juncture of the stupa body and its base, a lotus throne featuring 24 upturned carved lotus petals makes a natural transition between the two parts. ,The Temple of Heaven, a complex of imperial religious buildings situated in the southeastern part of central Beijing, founded in the first half of the 15th century, is a place where emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties in China worshiped heaven for bumper harvests. The Temple of Heaven was inscribed as a World Heritage site in 1998 and was described as ""a masterpiece of architecture and landscape design."",Beijing Olympic Park, also known as the Olympic Green, is located in Chaoyang District, Beijing, with a total land area of 11.59 square kilometers.

Caution needed in Japanese alliance,"

    11:51, 13-Jan-2023

            ","China's Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian suggested earlier this week that Australia should be more cautious about Japan's remilitarization when responding to Japan's Ambassador to Australia Shingo Yamagami, who gave hawkish remarks about China.,Ambassador Xiao said, ''During the Second World War, Japan invaded Australia, bombed Darwin, killed Australians and treated Australian POWs in a way that is humanly unacceptable. And the Japanese government has not apologized for that up to today. If they don't apologize, it means they don't accept it's wrong, and they might repeat the history.'',The use of the Nazi swastika symbol is banned in many countries, but the rising sun imperial navy flag continues to fly it on the stern of Japanese warships. This unbroken link with the past symbolizes Asia's concerns with Japan's remilitarization. It's a concern ignored  by the United States and its Pacific allies.,The core concern is found in the post-War differences between the two main aggressors. Germany acknowledged its fascist past. Germany's past was forgiven but not forgotten. Japan has not reconciled with its militaristic past and its abuses in China and Asia. Japan ignores these stains on its national moral character.,This includes their denial of the Nanjing Massacre with an estimated more than 300,000 deaths. It includes the horrors inflicted by Unit 731, which conducted biological and chemical warfare tests with more than 3000 civilian deaths. It includes the wholesale slaughter of civilians in China and Asia. Memorials to the Sook Ching massacre in Singapore and similar atrocities elsewhere in Asia, are a reminder of an unrepentant aspect of Japanese culture.,Although the atrocity-denial industry in Japan is the province of minority groups, these groups remain highly influential in the nation's politics. Accordingly, many Japanese are unaware of Japan's wartime atrocities.,Possibly the single most alarming reminder of the entrenched nature of the project to secure a military rebirth of Japan is the continuous veneration of war criminals at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine. Many political leaders continue to venerate as war heroes over 1,000 convicted war criminals and 14 A-Class war criminals.,Former Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe visited when he was in office and regularly sent tributes, prior to his assassination last July. It's common for senior, serving Japanese politicians to send tributes to this shrine. The current Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida did so a few months ago.,These are not issues that can be ignored because they belong to the past. They are issues that reflect a refusal to accept cultural change at an institutional level. In Germany there are cultural barriers to the resurgence of fascism. In Japan there are fewer barriers to this similar resurgence because the past is not acknowledged. This means, unlike modern Germany, there are not the same cultural constraints on the abuse of military power.,While this may not concern the United States and Australia, it does concern Asia and China. They bore the brunt of this unrepentant Japanese attitude. The estimated more than 35 million Chinese deaths in China was a huge scar. This is not to diminish the sacrifices made by all parties, but it underlines why there are differences in response to Japan's increasing militarization and its journey towards overturning the peace constitution.,""This terrible foolishness will be acutely noted by China, of course. But it will also be sharply perceived across East Asia and South East Asia and in the developing world more generally,"" said Richard Cullen, adjunct professor at the University of Hong Kong. He suggests that Japan is an unfit nation as a military ally because of its denial of its history.   ,Prime Minister Kishida and his predecessor Abe have long been proponents of the expansion of the Japanese military's role outside the country. Many in the region do not embrace Japan's military expansion, even if it is part of a broader U.S. engagement.,As Ambassador Xiao inferred, Australia should not assume its increasing alliance with and support for a remilitarizing Japan is welcomed by Asia. This undermines Australia's efforts to improve its diplomatic standing in the region."

Microplastics in the ocean has tripled,"

    13:13, 13-Jan-2023

            ","A recent study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology shows that the total amount of microplastics deposited on the sea floor has tripled in the past 20 years.,Microplastics, referring to plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, are known by scientists as PM2.5 in the ocean. Since the 1950s, a large amount of plastic waste has entered the ocean due to the uncontrolled spread of white pollution.,Every year, millions of tons of plastic garbage enter the ocean under the action of wind, precipitation and surface runoff, said Ju Mowei, senior engineer of the National Marine Environment Monitoring Center. Large pieces of plastic garbage are influenced by sunlight, waves and biology, gradually aging and breaking down which is difficult to observe. In addition, clothing fibers and worn rubber particles from tires, are also the main sources of marine microplastics.,The presence of microplastics has been found in populated areas and ocean circulation zones, and even in North and South Polar sea ice and deep-sea sediments.,Studies have shown that microplastics can be ingested directly or indirectly by marine animals due to their small particle size. However, this can block the feeding organs and digestive tract, causing physical damage and toxicological effects. On the other hand, it can be enriched in marine organisms and transmitted with the food chain, which may cause harmful effects on other organisms.,Microplastics also adsorb some pollutants, such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. It will accumulate after being released in the organism and is passed along the food chain, which may pose a potential risk to the organism or human health.,Microplastics have also been found in table salt, tap water and bottled water. Microplastics can enter the body with seafood such as fish, shrimp and shellfish. However, microplastics that are ingested by humans are quickly excreted and there is no evidence that they can harm the human body.,Marine litter and microplastics affect marine ecology at all times. The public should reduce the use of disposable plastic products, separate garbage and not dispose of garbage randomly to protect the marine ecological environment."

China timely optimizes COVID-19 response for good reasons,"

    14:29, 14-Jan-2023

            ","From January 8, 2023, China starts managing COVID-19 with measures designed for combating Class B infectious diseases, instead of Class A infectious diseases. Such a downgrade in management measures is another major adjustment in China's COVID-19 response policy, ushering in a new phase of the COVID-19 response in China.,For a long time, the Chinese health authorities have divided infectious diseases into three categories according to their transmission speed and degree of harm.,Class A infectious diseases, such as the plague and cholera, spread quickly and are the most harmful, and are managed through mandatory measures. The Class B infectious diseases, which include tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS, just require strict responses. Class C infectious diseases, on the other hand, are those under active monitoring and management.,Classified management, dynamic adjustment and science-based precision control have been the basic strategy of China's response to infectious diseases. The latest adjustment of China's epidemic prevention and control measures is also based on this strategy, which is a proactive and scientific approach to COVID-19 prevention and control.,In terms of pathogenic features, the pathogenicity of Omicron is lower than that of other variants, and its impact on the health of the population is within a controllable range. This is the premise for the adjustment of China's response measures.,The Omicron variant mainly invades the upper respiratory tract, and the infected people mostly have symptoms such as fever, dry or sore throat and cough, while the proportion of patients with serious illnesses such as pneumonia in the lower respiratory tract is low. Less than 10 percent of the patients develop pneumonia, and the share of patient suffering critical conditions is low, according to China's National Health Commission.,The low pathogenicity and manageable impact of the disease have guided the policy shift on China's COVID-19 response, which is in line with the interests of the vast majority of the Chinese and a testament to China's commitment to putting people's life first.,And in terms of infectious features, Omicron spreads very fast, with R0 (basic reproduction number) even exceeding 20. It's difficult to prevent and control Omicron with lockdown measures. This is the background for the adjustment of the COVID-19 response policy in China.,The symptoms of Omicron-infected patients are similar to those of influenza patients, and it's difficult to distinguish between the two infections. This has led to a significant increase in cases due to the widespread movement of infected people at the community level.,Over the past year, Omicron has spread to all parts of the world. Global prevention and control practices have proven that Omicron cannot be eradicated. Therefore, China chose to optimize its response to COVID-19, balancing epidemic control with socio-economic development. The adjustment is made based on the current reality of COVID-19 response and in line with the global response strategy against Omicron.,Moreover, in terms of the timing of the adjustment, it is done during the window of opportunity for a shift in response strategy. Doing it before or after this time window is undesirable. As Liang Wannian, head of China's COVID-19 response expert panel under the National Health Commission, said that if China's response policies were adjusted earlier, China would have been underprepared over the pathogenicity of the disease, the experience in transmission control and level of immunity of the population. A hasty adjustment could have led to an incalculable impact.,The vaccination rate of the Chinese is on the rise, especially among high-risk groups such as the elderly. For example, the full-dose vaccination rate of people aged 60-79 in Henan Province is 98.49 percent and that of the elderly in Hubei Province reaches 90.7 percent. The level of immunity among the entire population has risen.,Likewise, if the adjustment is delayed and the best time window is missed, as the virus mutates constantly and may get even more dangerous, the impact of a belated policy adjustment could make matters worse. Given that the Omicron variant is less pathogenic than previous variants, it is best to adjust the response strategy and measures now.,China has also made preparations for optimizing the COVID-19 response. China has made an array of active adjustments to optimizing the COVID-19 response, such as 20 measures on November 11 last year, 10 new measures on December 7, etc.,The optimization is gradual and based on the latest developments. The policy changes are necessary, timely and science-based by following closely on the features of the virus and its transmissibility. They are made with good coordination and planning by analyzing the changes in the epidemic situation.,The downgrade in the management of COVID-19 as a Class B infectious disease is a proactive move to optimize response measures based on a comprehensive assessment of the pathogenic and infectious features of the virus and with careful consideration over the timing. It demonstrates the scientific, precise and effective nature of China's epidemic prevention and control work."

""This phenomenon is mainly caused by varying water depths of the lake. Every winter the water freezes at different speeds, leading to ice layers with different thicknesses. Besides, water expands and takes up more space when it becomes ice. The ice layers will then squeeze one another to cracks.

China-Africa health cooperation is blossoming,"

    11:12, 14-Jan-2023

            ","On January 11 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and African Union (AU) Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki Mahamat inaugurated the China-aided Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).,The project, apart from its palpable direct impacts over the health infrastructure in the continent, reveals the significance of health cooperation between China and Africa while taking the strategic partnership to new heights. Qin said it's another milestone for China-Africa cooperation after the African Union (AU) Conference Center, showing the world with irrefutable facts that China has never made an empty promise.,Africa has grappled with myriads of health challenges as the continent is deprived of a robust health system and infrastructural development. Besides member states' fragile health structure, continental organization such as Africa CDC, as a newly established AU technical agency existing only for five years, is yet to constitute the needed capacity to endure current and future health difficulties.  ,The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed serious shortcomings in national and continental health systems, overwhelming surveillance and testing capacity. Consequently, numerous communicable and non-communicable diseases have been rocking the continent while leaving hundreds of thousands of people to die and many more succumbing to a long illness. The recurring nature and vicious cycle of disease occurrence has pushed a sizable portion of Africa's population to the brink of poverty.,Consistently, in February 2022, Africa Development Bank (AfDB) reported the health challenges triggered by many factors across Africa are causing significant hardships. Despite recent progress, child and maternal mortality remain high in many African countries. With just 15 percent of the world's population, Africa accounts for an estimated 50 percent of global deaths from communicable diseases. Poor health outcomes reflect a lack of access to quality health services: a third of Africans live more than two hours away from health services, and there are severe shortages in hospital beds, medical equipment, and drugs.,The economic costs of health challenges are severe. It is estimated that Africa loses $2.4 trillion in annual output due to poor health. This statistical information infers the fragile nature of Africa's health sector while hinting a hazy future if necessary measures are not taken promptly and comprehensively.   ,Due to these threats, the Africa health arrangement necessitated reconsidering its approach and committing to a new dynamism that could transform the status quo into a long-term positive trajectory. Africa's health investments must grow exponentially in order to build large and diverse health infrastructure that meets current and future needs, as well as the needs of its growing populations.,According to the AfDB, the $4.5 billion in capital expenditure currently made by Africa governments each year is far below the estimated $26 billion in annual investment needed to meet evolving health needs over the next decade. The Africa governments and corresponding actors must rally round resources mobilization and channeling more finance into the sector. The long-term investment must be substantial and strategic as the continent is struggling with health challenges that have negative economic and social repercussions.,So, investing in the health system in Africa is essential not only to create a robust health system but to achieve sustainable development targets.,The newly inaugurated Africa CDC could fill an essential niche as a health infrastructure in the continent. The center comes equipped with modern laboratory, training, conference, and data centers to accelerate the continental-wide response efforts. Moreover, it will serve as an important impetus to make a wide variety of surveillance activities and find proper medications for ongoing and emerging health problems. The institution will feed Africa's ambition to produce and to distribute vaccines for future pandemics.,The facility strengthens the continent public health system in a manner that benefits Africans. Accordingly, the support is instrumental in realizing the Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030), which would create better performing health sectors while addressing key challenges to reducing the continent's burden of disease.,China's health assistance in Africa has been most effective in three areas: public health infrastructure, medical service capacity, and human resources development. The collaboration is blossoming and gaining momentum on top of expanding into new areas of engagement. Qin also reiterated China's commitment to strong solidarity on various sectors including health.,Africa should continue to seize this opportunity to collaborate with China and achieve mutual development. Africa could further address the root causes of health infrastructure. The likes of Africa CDC facilities need to expand to the level promoting quality health coverage for all in the continent."

            ","China's imports and exports topped 40 trillion yuan (about $5.97 trillion) in 2022, for the first time, against all odds including rising global economic recession risk, shrinking demand and COVID-19 disturbance.,Data by the General Administration of Customs (GAC) on Friday indicated China's total trade in goods reached a record 42.07 trillion yuan last year, up 7.7 percent year on year, topping the world for six consecutive years.,""Market and product are the keys to China's exports,"" said an opinion piece for China Media Group (CMG).,China has consolidated and expanded its trade ""friend circle."" The international market share of its exports reached 14.7 percent, ranking first in the world for 14 consecutive years.,China's exports to major trading partners such as ASEAN and the European Union have maintained rapid growth. Those to countries along the ""Belt and Road"" have increased by about 20 percent, driving overall export growth by 6.1 percentage points.,The rapid development of emerging industries such as the green economy has also added new impetus to foreign trade. The export of solar cells and lithium batteries increased by 67.8 percent and 86.7 percent respectively.,The new energy vehicle (NEV) industry also miniatures China's foreign trade, enhancing its international competitiveness in recent years. Chinese auto companies exported 593,000 NEVs in the first 11 months of 2022, doubling year on year, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. ,""This fully shows that the global market is inseparable from 'Made in China,' and China's status as the 'world factory' hard to be replaced,"" the CMG opinion piece wrote. ,Moreover, the government and the private sector have made efforts hand in hand to offset COVID-19's impact on production.,Local authorities in coastal regions have organized foreign trade enterprises to go abroad actively expanding orders. Among 47 enterprises from south China's Guangdong Province that went to Malaysia, 43 had signed agreements such as order contracts, and the on-site transaction and intended transaction volume reached $23.5 million.,China's economic indicators have created favorable conditions for imports. In the first three quarters of 2022, the country's GDP reached over 87 trillion yuan (about $12.9 trillion), a year-on-year increase of 3 percent at constant prices. The added value of industries above the designated size and the investment in fixed assets have also maintained growth.,China has been the second-largest importer in the world for 13 consecutive years. It is the export destination of 210 countries and regions and the main export market of 60 countries and regions.,The steady performance of China's foreign trade benefits from policy support. Since last year, the Chinese government has rolled out measures to promote the stability and quality of foreign trade enterprises, in order to help them cope with difficulties in logistics and finance.,With these policies and measures taking effect one after another, the vitality of China's foreign trade entities has been effectively released. In 2022, the number of foreign trade companies that have gained actual performance has increased by 5.6 percent over the previous year.,Expanding domestic demands and promoting high-level opening-up are the buzzwords in the annual Central Economic Work Conference in December, which have set the tone for China's vigorous foreign trade in 2023.,As China's COVID control measures enter a new chapter, ""the decision to accelerate China's reopening is a boost for the global economy at a time when activity in the United States and Europe is weakening after repeated interest rate hikes by central banks to cool surging inflation,"" said CMG opinion piece citing an Associated Press commentary."

            ","Reproducing ion channel-based neural functions with artificial fluidic systems has long been a goal for both neuromorphic computing and biomedical applications. ,Chinese scientists have now made a breakthrough by developing a polyelectrolyte-confined fluidic memristor (PFM), which is expected to promote the reading and interaction of ""chemical language"" of the human brain, and provide new ideas to develop neurointelligent sensing, brain-like intelligent devices and neurosensory prosthetics. ,The study, conducted by scientists from Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences, Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Living Biosystems, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), was published in the international journal Science,on January 12, 2023.,In the study, neuromorphic functions were successfully accomplished with a PFM, in which confined polyelectrolyte-ion interactions contributed to hysteretic ion transport, resulting in ion memory effects.,Various electric pulse patterns were also emulated by the PFM with ultralow energy consumption. The fluidic property of the PFM enabled the mimicking of chemical-regulated electric pulses, according to the study. ,More importantly, chemical-electric signal transduction was implemented with a single PFM. With its structural similarity to ion channels, a PFM is versatile and easily interfaces with biological systems, paving a way to building neuromorphic devices with advanced functions by introducing rich chemical designs, according to the study. "

Embassy Spokesperson on the Six-monthly Report on Hong Kong Released by the UK,"

    04:08, 13-Jan-2023

            ","The following is a readout of a Chinese embassy spokesperson's comments on the UK's recent report on China's policy in Hong Kong.,On 12 January, the British government published its 51st Six-monthly report on Hong Kong, commenting on China's policy in Hong Kong and criticizing the National Security Law. What's your response?,China’s position on Hong Kong-related affairs is consistent and clear. In disregard of China’s solemn stance, the UK went ahead to publish the so-called Six-monthly report on Hong Kong. It distorted facts, grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, and seriously violated the basic norms governing international relations. We are strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to it, and have lodged stern representations with the British side.,Since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland, the central government of China has fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. ,Improvement of Hong Kong’s electoral system reflects the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong. Today, Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms according to law than under British colonial rule. Facts have fully proved that the democratic system of the special administrative region conforms to both the policy of One Country, Two Systems and the region's constitutional status. ,It is in the interest of Hong Kong residents' democratic rights and the region's prosperity and stability. One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement securing enduring prosperity and stability for Hong Kong after its return.,China's enactment and implementation of the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to thrive. This has been widely welcomed and sincerely supported by all sectors in Hong Kong. ,The interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the relevant provisions of the National Security Law is conducive to clearing up doubts and quelling disputes, helping to standardise the judicial procedures for hearing cases under the National Security Law, and helping to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and stable economic and social development there. ,This is what the majority of people in Hong Kong desire. It is a necessary action to fully and accurately implement the National Security Law and effectively maintain national security in accordance with the law. It will only strengthen the rule of law in Hong Kong and better safeguard the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents.,The core content of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is to ensure China resumes exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It does not give the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong after its return. ,By repeatedly citing the Joint Declaration as an excuse to make irresponsible remarks on China’s policy in the Hong Kong SAR, the UK is grossly disrupting and undermining the development of democracy in Hong Kong. ,Whatever cards the British side may play, be it the BNO passport or the leaving of British judges, it cannot hold back Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity, or China’s resolve in unswervingly implementing the One Country, Two Systems, defending national security and upholding Hong Kong’s rule of law.,Hong Kong has long been returned to China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. We urge the UK side to recognize the reality and major trend, discard the colonial mindset, and respect China’s sovereignty and unity. ,The UK must stop violating basic norms governing international relations, stop any interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, and stop undermining Hong Kong’s democracy, rule of law and prosperity and stability."
