            ","Chinese people are embracing a bustling winter after the country downgraded its COVID-19 management policies. ,It's a breakthrough in the country's three-year fight against the pandemic, but challenges still lie ahead. ,Along the journey, China went all out to protect its people and shared its valuable experience with the world.,China has seen declining numbers of fever patients, emergency visits and critical COVID-19 cases across the country, according to statements at a press conference held by the State Council joint COVID-19 prevention and control mechanism on Saturday.,The number of critical cases in hospitals peaked on January 5 at 128,000, and dropped to 105,000 on January 12, said Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission (NHC).  ,To strike a balance between saving lives and ensuring economic activity, China's COVID-19 policies have bought time in which greater protections have been developed,and the virus has become less deadly.,As of January 13, over 661 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and over 6.7 million related deaths had been reported globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).,China's death rate per 100,000 people stood at 2.29 as of January 13, according to the WHO, which is 1/37 of the global average and 1/143 of the United States.,The case fatality rate in China was 0.31 percent, far below the 1.01 percent global average and the 1.09 percent of the U.S. as of January 13, data from the WHO showed.,Putting ""people first, life first"" at the core of COVID-19 policymaking, China owes its low death rate to its strict prevention and control measures in the past three years.,""Based on the global average infection rate, China has prevented about 47.84 million infections and 950,000 deaths,"" said Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, at a public meeting in November of 2021.,At that time, Wu presented the figures to explain why China had to stick to its dynamic zero policy even though the U.S. and some European countries had relaxed their prevention and control strategies.,If projected using the death rate in the U.S., China has prevented over 3 million deaths, Wu added.,When the outbreak first occurred in 2020, China took strong measures to prevent the virus' further transmission by shutting exit channels, which created valuable space for the international community to make preparations.,China has been consistently sharing its information on the epidemic. It promptly reported the outbreak to the WHO, shared the genome sequencing results with the world and published its control and treatment protocols. All these moves facilitated COVID-19 prevention and control in the international community, and the research and development of vaccines and testing tools.,In order to share its experience, the country organized over 300 exchange events on epidemic control and medical treatment with over 180 countries and regions and more than 10 international organizations, according to the NHC. In addition, 37 medical teams were sent to 34 countries to help out at the front line.,During the past three years, China has updated 10 pilot editions of COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment protocols. As traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been found to be beneficial in the treatment of the disease, China has held over 100 video exchange and live-streaming events to introduce TCM diagnosis and treatment methods to more than 150 countries and regions.,During the precious low-infection window its policies created, China worked against time to develop COVID-19 drugs while promoting vaccination.,Both domestically developed and imported drugs have been approved for emergency use by China's medical products regulator. More than 10 oral drugs for COVID-19 treatment are being researched and developed in China.,So far, 13 COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the National Medical Products Administration for conditional marketing or emergency use in China. They can be inhaled or given to people through injection and nasal spray.,To build an immunity barrier against the virus, the Chinese government provided free vaccines for all and continued to improve the vaccination rate. The number of people in China fully vaccinated accounted for over 90 percent of the total population as of mid-December 2022.,Meanwhile, over 4.6 million Chinese citizens living and working in 180 countries have benefited from the ""Spring Sprout"" vaccine campaign, China's global campaign to inoculate its nationals living and working abroad, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.,China was the first country to announce it would make its COVID-19 vaccine a global public good. It also took the lead in waiving intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines and conducting joint production with developing countries. The country has offered more than 2.2 billion doses of vaccines to over 120 countries and international organizations.,It also provided hundreds of billions of epidemic control materials to 153 countries and 15 international organizations."

He believes that compared with 2019, Xinjiang's social development has reached a new level, and relations among ethnic groups have become more harmonious.,""Xinjiang is going in the right direction,"" Ali said.

            ","Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, China has been actively engaged in international cooperation to combat the crisis and has made important contributions to the global fight against the virus. China has provided more than 2.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine to over 120 countries and international organizations. It has also provided massive amounts of anti-pandemic supplies to more than 150 countries and 15 international organizations, and dispatched expert medical teams to 34 countries. China is playing an active role in controlling the pandemic and achieving stable economic recovery for the entire world.,During the past three years, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread around the world and the virus has continued to mutate. Coupled with other important factors such as the trade frictions between China and the United States and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the global supply chain has been severely disrupted and the world economy is recovering slowly.,As the ""world's factory,"" China has the most complete and largest industrial system on the planet and plays a ""ballast"" role in the global supply chain. China took the global lead in resuming production by implementing strict COVID-19 prevention measures and developing a set of effective methods to resume production. That helped make China the most stable and reliable production base in the world during the pandemic. It is because of China's determination to fight the pandemic that the world avoided a more serious challenge. The year 2020 saw China's economy expand 2.2% during the worst part of the global pandemic. That made it the only major economy in the world with positive growth. China's economic development provided a significant contribution to global economic stability.,China has continuously improved its COVID-19 response efforts. It has coordinated pandemic prevention and control measures with economic and social development, and has made important contributions to ensuring the stability and smoothness of the global supply chain while promoting the expansion of the world economy. China's economic growth reached 8.1% in 2021, far ahead of other major economies. Moreover, China's total import and export of goods grew 21.4% in 2021, exceeding a record $6 trillion. From January to November 2022, China's total import and export of goods expanded 8.6% year-on-year. While sharing its large market with the world, China continues to steadily deliver cost-effective products internationally and help maintain the stability of the global supply chain.,The pandemic remains at a high level globally and the virus continues to mutate, so there is still great uncertainty about the pandemic and the world economy. However, the long-term positive fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain unchanged, China's position as an important engine of global economic growth remains unchanged, and the international community's confidence in the Chinese economy remains unchanged as well.,China will continue to communicate and cooperate extensively with countries around the world to lead the global economic recovery. As China actively improves its COVID-19 response measures, domestic and international institutions predict that the country's economy will experience a restorative rebound in 2023, giving greater strength to the world economy."

So far, no newly emerged mutated strains have been found in China.”,In order to improve the gathering and recording of statistics, the State Council joint COVID-19 prevention and control mechanism team has released a new epidemic surveillance plan for COVID-19 infection, said Wu.,The plan adopted a monitoring method with various channels, including reporting and monitoring of hospitalized cases, and digital statistics of nucleic acid antigen detection.,Wu said China CDC also monitored key institutions like nursing homes as well as respiratory symptoms in school students and the tests of some COVID-19 patients.,So far, China has set up more than 500 sentinel surveillance sites across the country.,The chief epidemiologist further mentioned that the country had ""adopted a variety of comprehensively statistical methods to accurately evaluate the occurrence and development trend of the epidemic,"" adding that, ""we can judge on the incidence, intensity, trend and timing of the epidemic, evaluating effect of its prevention and control.” ,In the past few years, many countries have adopted such a statistical method, which reflects the overall situation through sampling, said Wu.,Small- and medium-sized cities and rural areas are likely to experience a peak of emergency and severe cases during the Spring Festival travel rush, said Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the National Health Commission (NHC).,Jiao said she made the observation in accordance with the trend of the epidemic, adding that these areas have seen a spike in COVID-19 infections ahead of the travel rush.,Major Chinese cities, including municipalities and provincial capitals, are passing or have passed the peak of infection. Now the big cities are seeing a downturn in the number of cases in emergency clinics, while the severe cases are still at a high level.,From last December to the beginning of this year, the utilization rate of beds in emergency and intensive care units in tertiary, prefecture- and county-level hospitals, has increased rapidly, according to Jiao.,As of December 25, 2022, the utilization rate of intensive care beds in secondary and tertiary hospitals nationwide was about 54 percent, but the number has since increased to 80 percent.,Jiao said it will be a test for the rural areas in dealing with severe cases during the Spring Festival, and the biggest challenge is whether these patients can be transferred to better-equipped hospitals in time.,Local officials have been urged to organize vehicles to help transfer critically ill patients in rural areas to hospital quickly.,These patients should be transferred to a county-level hospital at the very least, said Jiao, or to a tertiary hospital in the nearby city if their condition is beyond the capacity of the county-level hospital.,""We require the establishment of 'green channels' between the city and the county. If patients cannot be transferred, experts from tertiary hospitals should come to the county-level hospital with equipment to help with the treatment of critically ill patients,"" said Jiao.,China adjusted its management of COVID-19 in China from Class A to Class B from Sunday, amid the 40-day Spring Festival travel rush from January 7 to February 15.,Managing COVID-19 with measures designed for Class B infectious diseases, down from Class A, is ""definitely not laissez-faire,"" Liang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 response expert panel under the NHC, told China Media Group.,The adjusted management does not change COVID-19 as a statutory infectious disease stipulated by China's law, which still requires stipulated prevention and control measures, including reporting cases, management and treatment of patients, and necessary public health and social interventions and monitoring, according to Liang.,For such a major infectious disease, the government cannot deal with it alone, Liang said, calling for joint efforts by all parties.,""Of course, while the government is taking the leading role, everyone still must do their job,"" he said.,(Cover: Passengers push their luggage out of the international arrival exit of Terminal 3 at the Beijing Capital International Airport, after the cancellation of nucleic acid testing and quarantine for inbound travelers, January 8, 2023. /CFP)"

Caution needed in Japanese alliance,"

            ","China's Ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian suggested earlier this week that Australia should be more cautious about Japan's remilitarization when responding to Japan's Ambassador to Australia Shingo Yamagami, who gave hawkish remarks about China.,Ambassador Xiao said, ''During the Second World War, Japan invaded Australia, bombed Darwin, killed Australians and treated Australian POWs in a way that is humanly unacceptable. And the Japanese government has not apologized for that up to today. If they don't apologize, it means they don't accept it's wrong, and they might repeat the history.'',The use of the Nazi swastika symbol is banned in many countries, but the rising sun imperial navy flag continues to fly it on the stern of Japanese warships. This unbroken link with the past symbolizes Asia's concerns with Japan's remilitarization. It's a concern ignored  by the United States and its Pacific allies.,The core concern is found in the post-War differences between the two main aggressors. Germany acknowledged its fascist past. Germany's past was forgiven but not forgotten. Japan has not reconciled with its militaristic past and its abuses in China and Asia. Japan ignores these stains on its national moral character.,This includes their denial of the Nanjing Massacre with an estimated more than 300,000 deaths. It includes the horrors inflicted by Unit 731, which conducted biological and chemical warfare tests with more than 3000 civilian deaths. It includes the wholesale slaughter of civilians in China and Asia. Memorials to the Sook Ching massacre in Singapore and similar atrocities elsewhere in Asia, are a reminder of an unrepentant aspect of Japanese culture.,Although the atrocity-denial industry in Japan is the province of minority groups, these groups remain highly influential in the nation's politics. Accordingly, many Japanese are unaware of Japan's wartime atrocities.,Possibly the single most alarming reminder of the entrenched nature of the project to secure a military rebirth of Japan is the continuous veneration of war criminals at Tokyo's Yasukuni Shrine. Many political leaders continue to venerate as war heroes over 1,000 convicted war criminals and 14 A-Class war criminals.,Former Japanese Prime Minster Shinzo Abe visited when he was in office and regularly sent tributes, prior to his assassination last July. It's common for senior, serving Japanese politicians to send tributes to this shrine. The current Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida did so a few months ago.,These are not issues that can be ignored because they belong to the past. They are issues that reflect a refusal to accept cultural change at an institutional level. In Germany there are cultural barriers to the resurgence of fascism. In Japan there are fewer barriers to this similar resurgence because the past is not acknowledged. This means, unlike modern Germany, there are not the same cultural constraints on the abuse of military power.,While this may not concern the United States and Australia, it does concern Asia and China. They bore the brunt of this unrepentant Japanese attitude. The estimated more than 35 million Chinese deaths in China was a huge scar. This is not to diminish the sacrifices made by all parties, but it underlines why there are differences in response to Japan's increasing militarization and its journey towards overturning the peace constitution.,""This terrible foolishness will be acutely noted by China, of course. But it will also be sharply perceived across East Asia and South East Asia and in the developing world more generally,"" said Richard Cullen, adjunct professor at the University of Hong Kong. He suggests that Japan is an unfit nation as a military ally because of its denial of its history.   ,Prime Minister Kishida and his predecessor Abe have long been proponents of the expansion of the Japanese military's role outside the country. Many in the region do not embrace Japan's military expansion, even if it is part of a broader U.S. engagement.,As Ambassador Xiao inferred, Australia should not assume its increasing alliance with and support for a remilitarizing Japan is welcomed by Asia. This undermines Australia's efforts to improve its diplomatic standing in the region."

Once called the ""throat of the region,"" it was an important military outpost and stronghold throughout Chinese history. Drums were used to warn about surprise attacks, boost soldiers' morale during confrontations and celebrate victory.,For this reason, some folk dance styles are reminiscent of military formations and require the dancers to devote their energy throughout the performance. Gao Yuchen, a local Grade 4 student, said it wasn't easy learning the drum dance at first. ,""I was not good at where to place the drum, and it left scratches on my fingers, but I wrapped them up and kept on practicing,"" he said. What drove little Yuchen was the vigor of the performance itself, to which he was drawn at first sight.,The boy dancers of the Ansai waist drum wear a white towel on their heads to represent traditional local farmers, while the girls tie their hair on each side like the horns of a goat, a vital livestock in the area. Along with the sounds of the Chinese red drum and other folk instruments, they drum and dance with leaping jumps and bountiful smiles. ,The Ansai district organizes school and district-level drum dance showcases every year, which the students, parents and teachers all look forward to. It's only the third year that Gao Yuchen has participated in the performance, and he helped his class win the first place in his year level.,Professional Ansai waist drum dancers have been part of such major events since the opening ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, which has proved a great motivation for young learners. ""I think everyone should try our waist drum,"" Yuchen said with pride, adding that he hopes to one day perform overseas. ,For the modern-day people of Ansai, the waist drum performance symbolizes saying goodbye to the past year and welcoming the new one. Watching the performance at the beginning of the New Year lets them look forward to the auspicious months ahead. Although faced with the challenging natural conditions of the Loess Plateau, the region presents a wonderful range of folk arts to reflect people's positivity and optimism for life.,Ansai is located in the north of historic Shaanxi Province, where the Terracotta Army of the first Chinese emperor was first discovered. The region lies in the very heart of China and overlooks the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization."

            ","Many countries, especially Southeast Asian nations, are welcoming Chinese tourists after China officially downgraded its COVID-19 management policy on January 8.,Under the new management policy, COVID-19 is , in the country. Mass testing no longer exists and citizens infected with the disease don't have to be quarantined. International arrivals also do not have to go through nucleic acid testing and quarantine.,The policy shift has received a positive response from many countries, including Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Zealand, which all have welcomed Chinese travelers.,Thailand announced its latest entry policy on January 5, saying that all people from other countries and regions will be treated equally and tourists from any country will not be required to provide test results for COVID-19, but they will still need to provide records of at least two injections of COVID-19 vaccine.,Tourism authorities in Thailand said the country is actively preparing for the arrival of Chinese tourists, and they are expecting at least 5 million Chinese tourist arrivals this year, nearly half of the 11.5 million Chinese nationals who visited in 2019.,""Marvelous Thailand has been waiting for you for three years,"" reads a Weibo post by Thailand's national tourist bureau, which also contains a hashtag that translates as: ""China orderly resumes outbound travel."",Uzaidi Udanis, president of Malaysia Inbound Travel Association, said the government would not impose special restrictions on Chinese visitors arriving after January 8. He welcomes Chinese tourists and predicted that about 3 million Chinese tourists would visit Malaysia this year.,Cambodia is also looking forward to the return of Chinese tourists. Prime Minister Hun Sen said last week that his country would ""not require Chinese people to do anything, just to come as normal tourists."" He predicted that Cambodia is expected to receive 2 million Chinese tourists this year. Prior to the pandemic, Cambodia was receiving more than 2 million Chinese tourists per year or nearly 40 percent of its total international arrivals. ,The Cambodian tourism ministry also extended a welcome to Chinese tourists, saying it is making preparations for the reception of Chinese tourists and encourages tourism companies to carry out relevant certification procedures as soon as possible and make preparations.,Indonesia has similarly announced that it will maintain its COVID-19 policy toward Chinese visitors, adding it will continue to monitor the situation. Currently, like all foreign travelers, Chinese arrivals are required to show proof of complete vaccination against COVID-19.,The Singaporean government too has said there would be no changes in COVID-19 measures for travelers from China. Foreigners who are not fully vaccinated need to undergo pre-departure tests before they can enter the country while short-term visitors are required to buy insurance for COVID-related medical expenses.,Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia Sandiaga Uno said on January 4 that the country is ready to welcome tourists from China. Moreover, Statistics Indonesia (BPS) recorded that Indonesia welcomed only 94,924 tourists from the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong during the January-October 2022 period, a sharp decline from 2.07 million tourists in 2019, he said.,""Hence, we are confident that this year's Chinese tourists' target of 253,000 would be achieved,"" Uno remarked.,In Vietnam, medical experts have urged the government not to restrict the entry of Chinese visitors or mandate COVID-19 tests for people coming from China. Localities and travel firms have quickly embarked on plans to welcome back Chinese tourists to Vietnam and take Vietnamese visitors to China. In 2019, the number of Chinese visitors to Vietnam hit 5.8 million, making up 28 to 30 percent of the total number of international arrivals to Vietnam.,According to Nguyen Thi Le Thanh, the director of the Department of Tourism of central Khanh Hoa province, Vietjet Air and China Southern (CZ) have planned to resume their operation from March 26, while Vietnam Airlines will re-operate its flights from the Chinese market on June 1.,The Philippines has not announced any plans to tighten entry restrictions for travelers from China as the health department is confident existing health protocols are sufficient, and that most of the population is fully vaccinated against COVID-19. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said in late December that it would keep its borders open to visitors from China, and recently voiced a welcome to Chinese tourists.,According to public statistics, around 32 million Chinese citizens traveled to the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2019, the year before the pandemic, but the figure dropped sharply to 4 million in 2020. With the scrapping of testing and quarantine for inbound travelers, Chinese international tourism will revive, which will help a full recovery of the Asia-Pacific tourism.,Unlike some other Western nations, New Zealand is also choosing not to impose restrictions on Chinese nationals. The country on January 4 announced that its quarantine requirements for international arrivals remain unchanged after assessment, noting that additional entry restrictions were ""neither required nor justified."",Except for tourism which will see a rebound in 2023, experts believe China's economy will recover rapidly in the new year, and this will inject new momentum into the global economy which has been stuck in low growth due to multiple factors such as the pandemic and geopolitical conflicts."

Will the disappearance of bees in Black Mirror become reality?,"

Black Mirror is just a TV series, but it also makes one reflect on what role bees play in human life.,The importance of bees in the Earth's ecosystem cannot be overstated. Bees give us honey, and they play their part either pollinating the many vegetables and fruits we eat directly or pollinating the food for the animals that we then consume.,According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, pollinators are involved in producing the food that feeds 1/3 of the world's population, and more than 85 percent of this pollination is done through honeybees. It is estimated that more than 2,500 honey bee species pollinate plants worldwide.,However, the honeybee population is declining significantly. In the future, it is likely that robots will be needed to take over the duties of bees for artificial pollination in order to preserve the diversity of vegetation.,Why are bee populations declining? For more than a decade, scientists have been searching for the cause of the decline in bee colonies. Since it is difficult to obtain samples of the disappearing worker bees, there is no definite conclusion so far.,However, several experts say that there are natural factors behind the decline, such as the invasion of various parasites and pathogens, as well as human factors, such as chemical pesticides, industrial pollution, destruction of bee habitats, and the potential interference of increased cellular communication facilities with the bees' ability to navigate.,According to a recent study by Anthony Nearman and Dennis vanEngelsdorp, the average lifespan of worker bees was 34.3 days 50 years ago and is now only 17.7 days.,(All images via VCG)"

The emerging 'face' of Sichuan Opera,"

    20:27, 09-Jan-2023

            ","Costumed performers breathing fire on stage or changing their masks a dozen times within the space of a single performance is a delight for audiences watching Spring Festival events for both the domestic and overseas Chinese communities. And these two stunts both have their origins in one of China's most important culture heritages: Sichuan Opera.,As the name suggests, the roots of Sichuan Opera lie in the mountainous Sichuan Province of southwest China, which is also famous for pandas and spicy food. Unlike Italian opera's emphasis on monologues and singing, Sichuan Opera involves several components that combine acrobatics, fire breathing, clown performances and so on. The most famous and mysterious component is face-changing.,It's hard to imagine beginners to Sichuan Opera start learning the art of face-changing, but 13-year-old Hu Yibo did just that. A native of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province, Hu was born into a Sichuan Opera family. His grandfather was an opera singer; his dad runs a Sichuan Opera house in the downtown area and Hu himself has ""art"" in his given name.,""I basically grew up immersed in Sichuan Opera,"" claims Hu. Despite having just reached his teens, years of training and performing in front of audiences have given him a sense of maturity. He wanted to start with face-changing because it was the act that first attracted him to the world of Sichuan Opera. ,""A lot of drilling is required to become a good face-changer,"" Hu smiles as he looks back over his learning journey.,Face-changing is a unique technique where the performer switches their painted silk face masks with a sweep of hand or the turn of a head in a split second. The purpose of the different colored masks is to help convey a new emotion or a change in personality. The technique is so revered that it's not widely taught but instead preserved by opera families or passed down from master to apprentice.,Hu's face-changing skills were passed on from his grandfather. Since more than a dozen masks are changed within the space of one performance, the layers are so thick that Hu always pours with sweat inside the masks. But the audience's reaction is his motivation.,""When I was little, people saw me practicing and said one day they'd come and see me perform, so I kept on training to be able to stand on the stage,"" Hu says.,Now as a young ""old hand"" of face-changing performance, Hu has enrolled in a Sichuan Opera training college to expand his repertoire. In the classes, he is taught clown routines, singing and martial arts moves. And as this ancient art form enters the curriculum, many more young performers can not only learn Sichuan Opera, but also ensure it keeps evolving.,It took time to transform the art of Sichuan Opera into standardized classes. Su Mingde, a seasoned Sichuan Opera performer who is also Hu's teacher, spent a great deal of time preparing and recording the music for the traditional clown performances which many of the other teachers now use. Su and Hu have both won national awards for their Sichuan Opera performances.,Thanks to these old and young performers, Sichuan Opera is not only the culture signature of Sichuan, but also an art form that's gaining popularity overseas."

            ","Chinese researchers have newly confirmed the significance of spatial scale-dependent dilution effects of biodiversity on plant diseases in grasslands, according to the Lanzhou University. The results of the study have been published in the journal Ecology.,The new study suggested that spatial scale plays an important role in predicting infectious diseases of plants, said Liu Xiang, a researcher from the College of Ecology under Lanzhou University and the leader of the study.,Suffering from rapid biodiversity losses, it is of both theoretical and practical significance to better understand the relationship between biodiversity and plant infectious diseases. The study team tested how spatial scale affects the direction and magnitude of the biodiversity-disease relationship.,The researchers utilized a long-term nitrogen addition experiment conducted in an alpine meadow in northwest China's Gansu Province, and tested how the sample area was affected by the relationship between plant species richness and foliar fungal disease severity.,The findings indicated that the dilution effect was more easily observed in a small area. The study could help explain the observed variation in the biodiversity-disease relationship in grasslands, said Liu.,Therefore, the spatial information should be valued in this framework for predicting infectious diseases under rapid biodiversity loss scenarios, Liu added.,The ""dilution effect"" implies that where species vary in susceptibility to bacteria or virus which could cause disease, higher diversity often leads to lower infection prevalence in hosts.,(Cover image via CFP)"

It also has provided assistance to the international community in various ways within its capacity, including donating medical supplies, sending medical experts and sharing pandemic prevention and control experiences.,China was the first country to pledge to make COVID-19 vaccines a global public good. It was also the first to support intellectual property rights exemptions for vaccine research and development and the first to cooperate with developing countries in vaccine production. China was the largest supplier of vaccines to other countries.,A 2022 report on international cooperation in China's COVID-19 vaccine industry released by the 21st Century New Health Research Institute showed that the country has supplied more than 2.2 billion vaccine doses to more than 120 countries and international organizations. China has also carried out joint research and development and production of COVID-19 vaccines with developing countries such as the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil. China has provided massive amounts of medical supplies to 153 countries and 15 international organizations, and sent medical teams to 34 countries. China's efforts have played a key role in addressing the global shortage of the COVID-19 vaccine and added confidence and strength to the fight against the virus in developing regions.,Due to the impact of COVID-19, extreme weather, loose monetary policies of major developed economies and other factors, international food prices remain high. Many low-income countries are trapped in the dilemma of ""unaffordable food"". The Russia-Ukraine conflict and the extreme sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the West on Russia have additionally impacted the global food industry chain and supply chain.,In 2020, despite the severe impact of the pandemic on international trade, China exported 3.54 million tons of grain to help alleviate the global food shortage to some extent. In 2021, China advanced the Global Development Initiative, making food security one of the eight key areas of cooperation. China also helped promote agricultural development in developing countries through emergency food donations, technical assistance and agricultural investment. China has conducted agricultural science and technology exchanges with over 140 countries and regions. It has also introduced more than 1,000 agricultural technologies to developing countries. That effort has resulted in an average 30-60% increase in crop production in project areas.,China has also taken an active part in the United Nations World Food Program, which has established a global humanitarian emergency warehouse and hub in the country. On the WTO platform, China has called for open food trade, and urged the lifting of unilateral sanctions and maintained the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains. It also has provided a fair and reasonable international trade environment for agricultural improvements in developing countries.,Developing countries have been plagued by debt in recent years, and the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic additionally exacerbated their liquidity and solvency problems. In response to the crisis, China supported the postponement of debt repayment under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative  by the G20, and reached agreements with many countries to defer or reschedule debt repayment, with a negotiated amount of $10.8 billion, much higher than that of other countries.,China has also helped developing countries overcome the economic, financial and public health pressures brought about by the pandemic through multilateral platforms such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The AIIB created a COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility in 2020 to support members and clients in alleviating and mitigating economic, financial and public health pressures arising from COVID-19. The effort has benefitted 12 countries including Indonesia, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Georgia, with a total value of over 5.9 billion U.S. dollars.,In general, over the past three years, China has conducted the most intensive and wide-ranging emergency humanitarian action since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It has made positive contributions to the world's response to the pandemic.

In contrast, global inflation is forecast to rise from 4.7 percent in 2021 to 8.8 percent in 2022, IMF said in October.,China's central bank is the only of its kind in the world that is not hiking interest rates aggressively to curb inflation, according to Jean Chia, chief investment officer at Bank of Singapore.,With a solid industrial foundation and a series of policies to ensure supply, China's foreign trade in goods has maintained a relatively high growth in the past three years, which has effectively alleviated the pressure on the global supply chain arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.,China has become the major trading partner of more than 140 countries and regions. The country's foreign trade in goods ranks first in the world. In 2021, its foreign trade volume surpassed the $6 trillion mark for the first time.,The country has also become a safe haven for foreign investors and is leading the world in foreign capital inflows. Its capital inflows continue to grow steadily amid the COVID-19 pandemic despite the global gloomy investor sentiment.,Global foreign direct investment (FDI) shrank by 42 percent in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while FDI inflow into China achieved a 4.5-percent growth against the downward trend. ,China has continuously cut taxes and fees to ease the burden on businesses to stabilize the economy. In 2022, about 2.4 trillion yuan worth of value-added tax credits were refunded to taxpayers' accounts, which was the largest refund in history.,Thanks to supportive tax and fee policies adopted by the government, over 80 percent of the country's privately or individually-owned businesses do not need to pay taxes, and the average tax paid monthly by eligible businesses in 2022 is 40 percent lower than that of 2019.,China's top leaders have pledged unwavering support for the private sector, as the fast-growing private sector has played a big role in creating new jobs, promoting technological innovations and stabilizing economic growth.,The private economy has continued to see strong growth despite challenges posed by COVID-19. From January 2020 to August 2022, the number of Chinese private enterprises expanded from 35.2 million to 47.0 million. In 2021, they accounted for 92.1 percent of all enterprises.,In 2021, the private sector contributed 48.6 percent of foreign trade, 56.5 percent of fixed-asset investment, 59.6 percent of tax revenue, over 60 percent of GDP, over 70 percent of technological innovations and more than 80 percent of urban employment.,As the risks of global economic stagflation and recession are rising in 2023, headwinds are obvious for China. However, the country has enormous potential, strong resilience and vast room to maneuver, and the fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain unchanged."

The new protocol introduces targeted TCM treatments for severe cases, and puts forward relatively complete therapeutic TCM solutions for children. ,The country has also developed a unique plan to treat COVID-19 epidemic by combining the use of both TCM and Western medicine for severe and critical patients. ,Currently, the importance of TCM in the battle against coronavirus is mainly reflected in three aspects. ,""First, intervention can be stratified for patients,"" Huang Luqi, deputy head of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said on January 4 at a press conference. ""Patients can choose proper TCM for home treatment to reduce the overloading risk and pressure on medical institutions and resources."",Second, patients with mild and ordinary symptoms can depend on TCM as the leading treatment, Huang noted.,Third, TCM plays a part in recovery. After nucleic acid turns negative, many patients still undergo cough, fatigue, sweating and other symptoms.,""TCM can treat those symptoms and exert its function in overall regulation of the body as a whole,"" Huang said.,China has been putting more and more effort to help patients in rural areas with TCM.,In Daming County, Handan City of north China's Hebei Province, doctors are going to rural sites, providing free consultations and diagnosis to elderly villagers, and distributing free medicines, most of which are TCM and mixtures.,""I've got medicine here twice, and after taking the medicine, my family members are feeling better,"" said resident Wang Aijiao.,""Our hospital and the fellow hospitals are sending doctors to villages twice a week,"" said Yang Chenjuan, a doctor from the Daming Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine.,""We also provide them with free Chinese herbal medicines, herbs for foot baths and TCM fumigations, as well as offer more health advice,"" Yang said.,TCM companies across the country are using advanced manufacturing processes to ensure adequate output of medicines, and refining and improving TCM theories and practices to contain diseases. ,The production lines of pharmaceuticals company Zhendong Group are running 24 hours a day to make the medicine products for prevention of COVID-19. ,""We have invested more in production of proprietary Chinese medicines with modern concepts, from the cultivation and storage of Chinese herbs to product development.

Its name refers to a wide grassland where the munching of sheep can be heard everywhere.,The dance performed by senior primary school children is called Batang Xianzi, Xianzi being the two-string instrument that accompanies the dance. Tashi Badro, a local fifth grade student, is the lead Xianzi dancer at her school.,Xianzi helped Tashi Badro come out of her shell. Due to her father's disability, her family is not very well off. As the oldest daughter, she is diligent but shy. ""After joining the school's Xianzi class, I made many friends and became a lot more outgoing,"" Tashi Badro recalls with a spark in her eyes.,Batang holds the best reputation for performing and preserving the Xianzi dance. The dance, dating back over 1,000 years, is crowned a living fossil of ancient Tibetan song and dance art, while Batang conserves thousands of original tunes and lyrics. The lyrics are poems that keep a record of local life from the past.,Tashi Badro not only learns the dance but also studies history through Xianzi. She and her friends took great interest in making the two-stringed instrument. However, the poetic lyrics were hard at first, and she took her time practicing until she could sing them.,Xianzi is performed by men playing the music and women dancing to it. ""We dance when we take a break from harvest or welcome guests over,"" said Tashi Badro. In fact, her mother was a good dancer in her youth and became Tashi Badro's dance inspiration.,The students dance in a circle or other formations, sometimes resembling a winding dragon. Their movements are slow and graceful.

How a Chinese travel-tech startup survived the pandemic,"

    19:26, 11-Jan-2023

            ","After enduring three consecutive hard winters, the long-awaited spring is finally arriving for China's tourism sector as the country lifts most of its mobility curbs. The entire travel sector and its practitioners have struggled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large majority reportedly leaving the business entirely, but some persevered and found breakthroughs.,One of the entrepreneurs who did not give up on the travel industry was Cheng Xiaoyu, founder of Lushu Technology Co., a company providing tailor-made journey plans to travel agencies. The company's focus had been on overseas tour plans, but demand collapsed when the virus struck the world.,Adapting to the new reality of the pandemic, Lushu turned to the domestic Chinese market. Cheng made several attempts to carry on her business, including launching luxury train rides in northwest China and building a metaverse in central Shanghai.,Along with partners, the company put out a 12-day trip on the New Orient Express which starts from Urumqi in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and sits on the route of the ancient Silk Road. Equipped with private shower rooms and queen-size beds, the carriage looks just like a leveled-up version of the iconic luxury train as portrayed in Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. Passengers will visit nature and cultural heritage along the trip.,However, rolling out the project was far from a smooth ride due to pandemic disruptions. The trip only proceeded twice in 2021 despite five being planned, and three out of four trips were canceled in 2022.,The outcome was very discouraging for organizers who invested considerable time and money beforehand. On the national level, many left the travel sector after similar setbacks.,A China Chamber of Tourism survey in early 2022 found that nearly 70 percent of travel sector practitioners in the country left the industry due to the pandemic.,""Who is willing to invest in good quality travel products when [they are] losing money every time?"" Cheng told CGTN in frustration.,The most painful time in these years came from seeing the same people who were once the most ambitious in the industry having their spirits dashed, she said.,""Rebuilding confidence is a long process,"" Cheng added.,Resilience is revealed when people decide not to give in to uncertainties and challenges. And Cheng switched her focus to building experiences based on a single spot after retreating from planning long-distance trips and tours.,She set up a new company with some partners in 2020, building a platform dedicated to the innovation of content and the creation of intellectual property based on several unique destinations. They aimed to replicate the Disney model, which is a place people revisit and have stars like Lina Bell, generate sustainable revenue. Lina Bell is Disney's hottest hit, a pink fox character developed by Shanghai Disney Resort.,Customers expect novel experiences from a trip. The old practice of tour guides navigating at a destination using anecdotes is less appealing when people get similar content from Douyin every day, said Cheng. Douyin is the Chinese version of TikTok. ,Providing an immersive, story-based experience to customers is the way forward in the sector, she added.,That was why the company built a metaverse-themed ""Metacity"" in central Shanghai where customers can find experiences that may have some similarities to sci-fi movies such as Ready Player One and The Wandering Earth.,The projects benefit from Shanghai City's plan for metaverse development and urban revival. The site is built on a national cultural relic protection site with over 90 years of history and also received technological assistance from district authorities.,Shanghai is working to inject vitality into older parts of the city. It is also supporting technologies to build a virtual world and targets to grow its metaverse industry to 350 billion yuan ($51.7 billion) in value by 2025.,Cheng said she empathizes with the ""lying flat"" mentality among young people, a buzzword that trended on Chinese social media last year. The attitude refers to just doing enough to get by.,Young people are full of creativity and curiosity but the pandemic suppressed their willingness to explore the world, she explained. Young people's will to search for poetry and the far afield is alive, but their enthusiasms may need a spark to ignite.,""If they don't bathe in the sun, they'll defiantly suffer deficiency in calcium,"" said Cheng.,Cheng suggested the introduction of a Youth Card, offering a discount on tickets for trains, museums, or shows to people in China under the age of 30 as a way to put money back into people's pockets to spur spending. ,A similar scheme has been used in countries like France and the UK to sell train tickets at two-third of the normal price to young adults.,China has set boosting consumer confidence and increasing consumption as the priorities of economic growth in 2023. The country has put out an array of , to support that. Moreover, its top banking and insurance regulator pledged to increase , for the catering and tourism industry this year.,, scrapping mass testing and quarantine requirements. Cheng predicted that overseas travel and domestic scene-based travel will boom together when pent-up demand is released.,China was the largest spender on global tourism before the pandemic and tourist hot spots are anticipating their return. Tourism authorities worldwide have recently been , and putting up advertisements in Chinese subway stations.,The Thai deputy prime minister even welcomed Chinese tourists at Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport in person on January 9. Thailand estimate that it would receive 10 million Chinese visitors this year, closing in on the pre-pandemic level at 11 million., ,Cheng expects an overall revival in the market will not arrive till May as people stayed put until overseas public health and supporting policies towards Chinese tourists become clearer. Lingering infections and surging costs resulting from a shattered travel supply chain also discourage travel in the near term.,The way forward may be bumpy for tourism in 2023, but with hopeful stories like Cheng's, the outlook right now sure is brightening."

            ","Having lived in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) during the ""Golden Age of Chinese Poetry,"" Li Bai (701-762) was a poetic genius, acclaimed from his own time to the present as a brilliant and romantic figure who used his literary talent to take Chinese poetry to new heights. He traveled to many mountains and rivers throughout the country, engaging in a spiritual journey while embracing the diversity of life. ,Artists of subsequent dynasties created numerous works to commemorate Li Bai and his poems, including the painting ""Li Bai in Stroll"" by Liang Kai from the Southern Song Dynasty. Although Liang used simple brushstrokes and light colors to portray Li Bai, the ethereal and other-worldly quality of his poetic genius was well exhibited. ,Produced by China Media Group, the cultural program ""China in Poetry and Painting"" invited the renowned actor Wang Luoyong to play the role of Li Bai, reanimating the scene depicted in his masterpiece.,""Li Bai in Stroll"" is a traditional Chinese ink painting by Liang Kai of the Southern Song Dynasty that is now housed at the Tokyo National Museum. In this masterpiece, the figure of the poet occupies the lower two-thirds of the painting. He is shown standing sideways wearing a robe, and seemingly in wooden clogs. His head tilts slightly upwards, as though he were gazing at the empty expanse above as well as the moon and the clouds. ,Although the strokes seem economical and simple at first glance, a deeper look reveals their subtle grace and profundity. With precise control of brush and ink, Liang captured the very essence of Li Bai. His facial features — forehead, nose, eyebrow, eye, lips and jawline — were depicted with delicate strokes. ,The poet is shown slightly wrinkling his brows, with a jet-black dot conveying the distant gaze of his observant eyes. His lips are slightly parted, prefiguring the formation of his poems. The outline of the figure and clothing are painted with broad strokes in an unrestrained style. ,Meanwhile, his shoes are presented with a few vague blobs of ink, conveying a sense of motion. Liang employed bold yet free brushwork to create a painting that was ahead of its time, capturing the unpretentious personality and laid-back aspect of the poet Li Bai as he ambles along, reciting some verses, creating an artistic effect in which the lines are reduced yet the spirit remains undiminished.,According to Kang Zhen, the vice-principal of Beijing Normal University, in order to create heirlooms such as this, one must have a profound insight into the object depicted. In ""Li Bai in Scroll,"" Liang used thinned ink to describe the robed figure in profile, gently striding forward with his hands clasped behind his back while set against a blank background. ,The well-designed contrast of the painting's spatial layout is thought-provoking. By highlighting the only character in the painting, Liang foregrounds the spiritual goals jointly by both himself and Li Bai — an unruly and unrestrained personality —in this masterpiece.,Hundreds of years later, contemporary artists continue to interpret the painting's charm in new ways. On the stage of ""China in Poetry and Painting,"" the actor Wang Luoyong, being cast as the protagonist, presents an audio-visual feast for spectators. ,With folk singing in the background, Wang recites his poems while walking through some virtual mountains, rivers and cities. The performance shows Li Bai's extraordinary imagination, fully endowed with vitality and enthusiasm. Despite having been hit by reality, he refuses to give up and keeps chasing his lofty dreams.,Li Bai's poems embody his sense of romance, chivalry, heroism, and freedom while traveling around the mountains and rivers of China. Many people who appreciate his poetry also respect the spirit that he conveyed, as reflected in ""Li Bai in Scroll."",Li Bai has left an artistic legacy for Chinese literature to build on, allowing generations of Chinese to feel that same sense of freedom as they relive the spiritual journeys he embarked on."

            ","An international team led by Chinese scientists has discovered a new type of carbon, the long-range ordered porous carbon (LOPC), the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in Hefei City, east China's Anhui Province, said on Thurday.,Carbon is one of the most common elements in nature. The atoms of carbon can bond together in multiple ways, resulting in various forms of carbon, such as graphite, diamond and amorphous carbon, which have been used in various fields.,New carbon materials including fullerene, carbon nanotube and graphene have been discovered successively and attracted people's attention.,To prepare such new carbon materials, researchers in the past either used extreme conditions such as high temperature and high pressure or microscopic processing technologies such as ultraviolet light and electron beam irradiation. It resulted in low yield and impure products and prevented people from exploring the properties and applications of such materials.,Zhu Yanwu, a researcher at the USTC, who led the team, heated C60 fullerene with lithium nitride to moderate temperatures and formed the polymerized C60 crystal forms and the LOPC.,Further study showed that the LOPC is a ""metastable structure produced during the transformation from fullerene-type to graphene-type carbons."",The LOPC – microscopically porous but completely retains the macroscopic periodicity of crystals – may have potential applications in energy storage, ion screening, load catalysis and other fields in the future, Zhu said.,""The charge injection technology used in this study is expected to be a new way to regulate crystal structure with atomic-level precision,"" Zhu added.,The study was published in the journal ,on Wednesday.,The reviewers said the results are compelling and is of great importance to the fields of crystallography and materials science, according to a report issued in the Chinese newspaper ,."

Renowned artist Huang Yongyu designs Year of the Rabbit stamps,"

    17:01, 12-Jan-2023

            ","As the artist who designed the first zodiac stamp in China, 99-year-old Huang Yongyu has made headlines again by creating stamps for the upcoming Year of the Rabbit. Creative, humorous, and conveying a sense of happiness, the new stamp series reflects the consistent artistic style of the renowned artist. And just like the much sought-after monkey stamp he created in 1980, the newly-released rabbit stamps attracted many collectors waiting in long queues.,In the new stamp series, the first stamp features a blue rabbit with a pen and paper writing New Year blessings to people everywhere. It toys with the wordplay between the terms for ""blue rabbit"" and ""blueprint,"" which sound similar in Chinese, with ""blueprint"" representing a bright future and good fortune.,The second stamp, depicting three rabbits chasing each other from head to tail, conveys a sense of vitality. If you look closely, there is a jade rabbit pounding medicine in the background, representing wishes of good health and happiness for people.,The rabbit is the fourth animal in the Chinese zodiac calendar and represents beauty, peace, prosperity, and harvest. Huang said he designed the stamps this way to convey a sense of happiness over Lunar New Year celebrations. ""Painting the rabbit stamps is a happy thing,"" he added.,""What comes to mind is that the first rabbit is not like a regular, gentle one. It suggests a sense of naughtiness, naivety, and a unique soul. I think it has something to do with Mr. Huang Yongyu's understanding of the zodiac,"" said Wang Jing, executive editor of the Year of the Rabbit stamps. She added that these latest works are consistent with the creative and humorous approach seen throughout Huang's career.,This unique creation style can also be seen when Huang Yongyu designed zodiac stamps featuring monkeys back in 1980 and 2016. As he recalled, he picked up a pen, got an idea and used his sense of humor to complete the creation of the monkey with some improvisation. A sense of joy and festivity has always been at the heart of what Huang seeks to convey to his audience.,That is Huang Yongyu, his creations are humorous but also deep in meaning. With his artistic career spanning decades, Huang has always managed to convey the deeper meaning of life in a light and natural way.,Huang Yongyu was born in central China's Hunan Province in 1924. He left his hometown of Fenghuang County while still in his teens, and traveled around China. His woodcut prints, color ink paintings and literary works brim with his passion for, and profound insights into, people from various groups and walks of life and the spirit of the times.,In addition, the veteran artist loves animals very much. Various kinds of animals are featured in his artworks. He once said of all the animals he has painted, rats inspire him the most.,""Rats always feel content and never starve to death. When being chased, they will hide or run away. It is unlucky if it comes across a cat. But if not, its life is good,"" Huang Yongyu explained humorously.,Back in 2017, Huang's paintings of the Chinese zodiac animals were exhibited at the National Museum of China in Beijing. All the animals appear lively, offering witty monologues or engaging dialogues that highlight their individual personalities. Viewers can easily sense the ""forever young"" mentality in Huang's work.,The weight of time is acknowledged, but told in an easy way. Today, at the age of almost 100, Huang Yongyu is still passionate about life and never ceases to create or explore new ideas."

How time banking programs enrich elderly care choices in China,"

    19:25, 12-Jan-2023

            ","For some older residents in Nanjing City, east China's Jiangsu Province, getting access to elderly care services can be as simple as placing orders with a few taps on the phone.,Through the time bank function on the app of My Nanjing, volunteers take orders and provide nearly 30 kinds of visiting services ranging from a haircut and food delivery to dental care or psychological therapy.,When a service is delivered, instead of money, what volunteers earn are ""time coins"" that can be used to redeem similar assistance in the future. The number of coins they receive depends on how many hours they spend performing these tasks.,Shi Xiulian, director of the time bank fund management committee of China Aging Development Foundation, leads the team that created the time bank platform in Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province.,""It started with a simple wish of helping out some elderly in our community in 2013,"" said Shi, who is also a college teacher.,Shi told CGTN that she never expected the pilot project to one day evolve into a national mutual-assistance platform with tens of thousands of volunteers.,Since its launch in 2019, over 60,000 volunteers have joined Nanjing's program, striving to build a more elderly-friendly city. This means a lot to a city whose average life expectancy exceeded 80 in 2021.,Every day, thousands of elderly people place orders on the platform. As of December 2022, more than 650,000 orders have been completed.,Shi attributed the program's success to the support of multiple departments of the Nanjing government. With the support of government policies, the program has gained the trust of citizens, Shi said, adding that over 11 percent of the platform's volunteers are aged 60 and above.,""The proportion of elderly volunteers is small because most of them still shoulder traditional responsibilities in the family, such as looking after grandchildren,"" said Shi. ""But they are the most active group among all volunteers."",Like Nanjing, populations in most Chinese cities are getting older. Today, one in seven Chinese is over 65. As the elderly population in the country continues to grow, more caregivers are needed. To help relieve the burden of elderly care, many places are piloting similar time banking programs.,Professor Chen Gong, director of the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, told CGTN that time banking can be used to activate social participation in dealing with an aging population.,Chen's team has been following the development of time banking in China and did in-depth research on time banks in 20 provinces in 2021.,Regional differences in the level of development and the degree of aging call for different types of time banks, Chen said.,The idea of time banking was put forward by American scholar Edgar Cahn in 1980. In the past 40 years, the model has been implemented in over 30 countries, especially those with a large aging population, such as Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia.,The idea emerged in China around 2000, and cities such as Shanghai, Beijing, Nanjing and Guangzhou were among the first batch to pilot the model in communities. But it is only in the last few years that it has seen rapid growth with support from local governments.,Last June, Beijing launched a city-level time bank program for elderly care services. After being trained, every citizen older than 18 can earn one coin for every hour they spend caring for an older person. They can either redeem these when they turn 60, or give them to older family members. People who save 10,000 coins could have a spot in a state-run care home.,According to the China Time Bank Blue Book 2022, released last November, the government-led model has been explored in more cities across China, such as the northwestern city of Xi'an and eastern cities of Qingdao and Wuxi. Over 300,000 people have applied to join these programs.,As China's birthrate continues to decrease in recent years, there are concerns about the sustainability of this cycle of goodwill.,""It needs time to tell whether a model is sustainable,"" Professor Chen said. ""The development of the time bank in our country is still in its infancy, and we will keep observing its changes and characteristics."",To achieve the ideal goal of building a nationwide platform that allows everyone to deposit and withdraw their time currency, solving the credit issue of time banks is important, Chen said.,Chen said local governments could learn from each other and optimize their own time banking system according to their needs and local conditions.,Having over 50 universities and colleges, Nanjing has turned to the potential of students.,Shi's team created positions especially for college students, turning the time bank platform into a community where young people could put what they've learned into practice. At present, young people account for the biggest proportion, over 40 percent, of Nanjing time bank's volunteers.,Recently, volunteers can also place orders on the platform, displaying the skills and services they offer. The elderly can choose whether to accept the new services according to their needs.,""The platform promotes communication between generations and helps create a harmonious social atmosphere,"" said Shi. ""Perhaps it could also prepare talents for the elderly care industry."""

The modernization of China, with a population of more than 1.4 billion, means great opportunities for global companies, including those from the U.S. and China will regularly listen to the views of foreign companies, including American companies, and continue to improve a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment, Wang said.,Allen said that the Bali summit has attracted much attention from the international community, at which the two heads of state carried out candid, in-depth and constructive communication, and it has greatly encouraged the U.S. business community. It is hoped that the two sides can proceed from some specific issues to strengthen communication and cooperation and enhance mutual trust.,He added that the U.S.-China Business Council has long been committed to promoting exchanges between the business communities of the two countries, and stands ready to continue to support cooperation between enterprises of the two countries and create a favorable environment for practical cooperation between the two sides."

Therefore, transport authorities in China have been improving their services and promoting technologies such as online ticket purchase, electronic tickets, and facial check-in, to guarantee people's safety and make trips easier during this period,"" said Ma Minshu, associate professor at Beijing Jiaotong University.,For travelers waiting for departure, it is common to have a meal in a restaurant at the railway station. But the intelligent restaurant at east China's Jinan Railway Station has brought a brand new experience for travelers.,Unlike traditional restaurants, the Gaotiexia intelligent restaurant has no human servers or chefs but is operated by robotic equipment.,""We have six automatic cooking devices.

Microplastics in the ocean has tripled,"

    13:13, 13-Jan-2023

            ","A recent study published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology shows that the total amount of microplastics deposited on the sea floor has tripled in the past 20 years.,Microplastics, referring to plastic particles less than 5 mm in diameter, are known by scientists as PM2.5 in the ocean. Since the 1950s, a large amount of plastic waste has entered the ocean due to the uncontrolled spread of white pollution.,Every year, millions of tons of plastic garbage enter the ocean under the action of wind, precipitation and surface runoff, said Ju Mowei, senior engineer of the National Marine Environment Monitoring Center. Large pieces of plastic garbage are influenced by sunlight, waves and biology, gradually aging and breaking down which is difficult to observe. In addition, clothing fibers and worn rubber particles from tires, are also the main sources of marine microplastics.,The presence of microplastics has been found in populated areas and ocean circulation zones, and even in North and South Polar sea ice and deep-sea sediments.,Studies have shown that microplastics can be ingested directly or indirectly by marine animals due to their small particle size. However, this can block the feeding organs and digestive tract, causing physical damage and toxicological effects. On the other hand, it can be enriched in marine organisms and transmitted with the food chain, which may cause harmful effects on other organisms.,Microplastics also adsorb some pollutants, such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. It will accumulate after being released in the organism and is passed along the food chain, which may pose a potential risk to the organism or human health.,Microplastics have also been found in table salt, tap water and bottled water. Microplastics can enter the body with seafood such as fish, shrimp and shellfish. However, microplastics that are ingested by humans are quickly excreted and there is no evidence that they can harm the human body.,Marine litter and microplastics affect marine ecology at all times. The public should reduce the use of disposable plastic products, separate garbage and not dispose of garbage randomly to protect the marine ecological environment."

Now, he pointed out, those media outlets are doing the same thing with the measures being optimized. ""It is very weird,"" he added.,In Jieh's opinion, the recent restrictions imposed by some Western countries targeting only Chinese tourists are unnecessary.

In particular, China has escaped the severe stagflationary crisis that struck the United States and the European Union.,""China's performance in both health and economy during the pandemic is in international comparative terms little short of a miracle -- above all in comparison to the Western countries,"" Ross penned.,China's average annual economic growth rate over the past three years was approximately 4.5 percent, higher than the global average and making an important contribution to global economic growth.,Today, the COVID-19 situation in the world's second-largest economy is improving and some provinces and cities have already passed their infection peaks, and life and work are returning to normal at an accelerated pace.,Anna Malindog-Uy, vice president of the Manila-based think tank Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute, said the Chinese economy will likely witness a robust recovery and upward trajectory, benefiting many countries across the globe."

Where can it be seen across China?,If you look at it closely, you will find out that rime is granular deposit of ice crystals rather than actual flowers. It is formed when small supercooled water droplets freeze on contact with a surface which is lower than zero degree Celsius. Because the droplets are small, they freeze almost immediately creating a mixture of tiny ice particles and trapped air.,It seems that all rime looks the same, but in fact, there are two types of rime, soft rime and hard rime. Soft rime is less dense than hard rime and appears similar to spikes. It can be easily shaken off branches or other objects with ease. Unlike soft rime, hard rime has a comb-like appearance. It is also more compact and amorphous than the soft one.,Rime is common to be seen in winter next to ponds, lakes and rivers. Rime Island, a small island on the Songhua River located in northeast China's Jilin Province, is featured by gorgeous rime, hence the name. The banks of the river are covered by luxuriant trees in winter, attracting a large number of travellers. ,Rime not only can form next to waters, it can also be seen on mountains at high altitude surrounded by overcooled clouds.

The way they are arranged in a day is the order in which they appear in the 12-year cycle. The 24-hour arrangement was made based on animals' natural routines and habits and with a twist of folklore.

            ","The following is a readout of a Chinese embassy spokesperson's comments on the UK's recent report on China's policy in Hong Kong.,On 12 January, the British government published its 51st Six-monthly report on Hong Kong, commenting on China's policy in Hong Kong and criticizing the National Security Law. What's your response?,China’s position on Hong Kong-related affairs is consistent and clear. In disregard of China’s solemn stance, the UK went ahead to publish the so-called Six-monthly report on Hong Kong. It distorted facts, grossly interfered in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, and seriously violated the basic norms governing international relations. We are strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposed to it, and have lodged stern representations with the British side.,Since Hong Kong’s return to the motherland, the central government of China has fully and faithfully implemented the policy of One Country, Two Systems under which the people of Hong Kong administer Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. ,Improvement of Hong Kong’s electoral system reflects the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong. Today, Hong Kong residents enjoy far more rights and freedoms according to law than under British colonial rule. Facts have fully proved that the democratic system of the special administrative region conforms to both the policy of One Country, Two Systems and the region's constitutional status. ,It is in the interest of Hong Kong residents' democratic rights and the region's prosperity and stability. One Country, Two Systems is the best institutional arrangement securing enduring prosperity and stability for Hong Kong after its return.,China's enactment and implementation of the National Security Law has helped Hong Kong enter a new stage in which it has restored order and is set to thrive. This has been widely welcomed and sincerely supported by all sectors in Hong Kong. ,The interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the relevant provisions of the National Security Law is conducive to clearing up doubts and quelling disputes, helping to standardise the judicial procedures for hearing cases under the National Security Law, and helping to maintain the rule of law in Hong Kong and stable economic and social development there. ,This is what the majority of people in Hong Kong desire. It is a necessary action to fully and accurately implement the National Security Law and effectively maintain national security in accordance with the law. It will only strengthen the rule of law in Hong Kong and better safeguard the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents.,The core content of the Sino-British Joint Declaration is to ensure China resumes exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong. It does not give the UK any responsibility over Hong Kong after its return. ,By repeatedly citing the Joint Declaration as an excuse to make irresponsible remarks on China’s policy in the Hong Kong SAR, the UK is grossly disrupting and undermining the development of democracy in Hong Kong. ,Whatever cards the British side may play, be it the BNO passport or the leaving of British judges, it cannot hold back Hong Kong’s transition from chaos to stability and prosperity, or China’s resolve in unswervingly implementing the One Country, Two Systems, defending national security and upholding Hong Kong’s rule of law.,Hong Kong has long been returned to China, and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs that allow no foreign interference. We urge the UK side to recognize the reality and major trend, discard the colonial mindset, and respect China’s sovereignty and unity. ,The UK must stop violating basic norms governing international relations, stop any interference in Hong Kong affairs, which are China’s internal affairs, and stop undermining Hong Kong’s democracy, rule of law and prosperity and stability."

Mike Gallagher will be the chair of the China committee. “China is the only country with the intent to reshape the international order and, increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to do it,” Gallagher said on the House floor Tuesday, quoting remarks from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken.,In a new Congress that has so far been marked by Republican infighting and Democratic resistance, McCarthy's bipartisan win highlighted how the China-as-competitor-to-U.S. stance became a topic that could bring some lawmakers together. The situation was also evident during the last presidential race when both U.S. President Joe Biden and then-President Trump campaigned on promises to take a tough stance on China.,Among 65 lawmakers who opposed the China Select Committee on Tuesday, Judy Chu, the Representative of California and the chairwoman of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, raised concerns about the committee’s potential to fuel xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans.,Representative James McGovern of Massachusetts, who voted to approve the proposed committee, also expressed worries that the China Selected Committee would focus excessively on the ideological competition. "
