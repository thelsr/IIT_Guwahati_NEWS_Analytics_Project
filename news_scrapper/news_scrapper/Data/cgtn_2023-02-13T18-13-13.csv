Chinese modernization contributes to human civilization,"

    11:57, 09-Feb-2023

            ","In Tuesday's speech to newly elected Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee members and alternate members, as well as principal officials at the provincial and ministerial levels, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China's development shows there are alternative methods to modernize for developing countries, breaking the myth that ""modernization equals Westernization."",President Xi, the general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, addressed China's senior officials at the opening ceremony of the study session at the Party School of the CPC Central Committee (National Academy of Governance). Xi expounded on the Chinese path to modernization, while the modernization process of a country should be ""suited to its realities"" and ""characterized by features unique to its context."",China's modernization path dates back to the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC). At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC held in March 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized building an industrial country, as well as a socialist country.,From the founding of the PRC in 1949 to the implementation of reform and opening-up policy in 1978, the Party carried out the ""Four Modernizations."" At the First Session of the First National People's Congress convened in 1954, Chairman Mao proposed a grand vision of transforming the country from ""an economically and culturally backward country"" into ""an industrialized country with a high degree of modern culture."" At the meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai endorsed modernization in four aspects: industry, agriculture, transportation and national defense, serving as the initial statement of the goal of Four Modernizations.,Amid the development of socialist construction, the CPC adjusted its strategic goal of national modernization in 1964 – to ""build China into a strong socialist country with modern agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology."" In the long period since then, ""Four Modernizations"" has been the common goal pursued by both the Party and the people with unremitting efforts.,After convening the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978, the Party charted a new path to modernization – socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. Then leader Deng Xiaoping proposed to build a ""Xiaokang"" society, or a moderately prosperous society.,At the turn of the 21st century, people's livelihood had greatly improved. But the central leadership assessed that the country remained at a relatively low level of Xiaokang. Therefore, then President Jiang Zemin advanced ""building Xiaokang in all aspects"" at the 16th CPC National Congress, which was reaffirmed by President Hu Jintao at the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012.  ,Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has made significant progress in theory and practice of developing the path to modernization. In November 2013, the Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee identified modernizing China's system and capacity for governance as the general objective for deepening reform, which has become the fifth pillar adding to the Four Modernizations, enriching the meaning of the socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics in the new era.,Now there is clear direction with a two-step strategic plan. The first step is to realize socialist modernization from 2020 through 2035, followed by building a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful from 2035 through the middle of this century. Chinese modernization involves the largest population, seeks common prosperity for all, coordinated material and cultural advancement, harmony between humanity and nature, and most importantly it is peaceful development.,This remarkable development of theory and practice in the Chinese path to modernization lies with maintaining firm leadership of the CPC, which is pivotal to the fundamental direction, realization and success of Chinese modernization. As Xi said, the historical task of exploring the Chinese path to modernization fell on the shoulders of CPC members.,Modernization is not a preserve only of the West, nor is there a fixed model. Each country could independently explore a unique path to modernization in line with its national context. Among the 193 member states of the UN, less than a quarter are developed countries, suggesting that modernization remains a major issue for the developing world. China has opened up a modernization path that not only maintains Chinese features, but has global significance, creating a new form of human civilization. With its rich experience, the Chinese modernization path can provide insightful references for other developing countries to seek their own paths to modernization."

            ","The Chinese women's national football team has entered the second stage of their preparations for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, manager Shui Qingxia said in an interview with China Media Group (CMG).,""We have been focusing on tactical practice recently,"" Shui said. ""We already finished the physical fundamentals previously in Haikou (capital of south China's Hainan Province). Now we switch to tactics to get ready for playing overseas."",Shui said in the beginning, many players were unhappy with the massive fundamental practice and that she helped them overcome the resentment. ,""After a period of practice, players felt stronger and were able to run more. Then they would realize how important strength training is,"" Shui told CMG.,Shui recruited some new faces for the training camp and the future development of the national team. ,""Honestly, I don't think we have enough young blood. It would be better if we have more,"" she said. ""Of course, they will have to go through some steeling, regardless of success or failure. That's how players grow."",Shui used Wang Linlin and her performance in the East Asian Football Federation E-1 Football Championship last year as an example. ,""Perhaps she didn't do well enough on one front, but she has established confidence after being given such an opportunity,"" Shui said.,Shui believes that young players will grow mentally after playing in international tournaments. ,""For example, during regular training, they will be motivated to do more. Our fundamental practice was very tough, but these players completed all of them. They have better self-affirmation than before,"" Shui said. ,""But it's a process of repetition. Some players may do one thing well but then cease to do so after several games. I think that's because they haven't been steeled enough, so we need to have them play in international games constantly."",The Chinese national team doesn't have a complete roster yet because some of the players haven't come back from foreign clubs, and some of those who have returned are not all in good form. However, Shui is convinced that allowing these players to go overseas is the right decision.,""I don't regret it at the moment. I still want to encourage some of our players to go overseas,"" Shui told CMG. ""But it's not an easy matter to judge right now."" ,""I just do what I think is right and good for team development. We can wait till the end to judge the result. I will accept whatever conclusion,"" she said."

"PM Hun Sen's visit reflects strong relations between Cambodia, China","

    11:03, 09-Feb-2023

            ","Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia Hun Sen is embarking on a three-day state visit to China from February 9 to 11. Both countries are expected to sign a series of bilateral cooperation agreements, particularly on infrastructure financing and construction.,Hun Sen's most recent trip to China, in February 2020, was the first visit by a foreign leader to Beijing since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the city of Wuhan. Hun Sen demonstrated political support for China and personally send a message of solidarity between the Cambodians and the Chinese. Meanwhile, in his appreciation of Hun Sen's visit, Chinese President Xi Jinping said. ""A friend in need is a friend indeed."" To the Chinese leader, Cambodia is indeed a friend to China.,Cambodia has stood tall as a strong supporter and one of the major beneficiaries of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) since 2013. Several large-scale infrastructure projects in Cambodia, which were funded by China, have been completed and put into operation, including a 190-kilometer-long expressway connecting Phnom Penh, the capital, and Sihanoukville.,The Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) is a high-profile bilateral cooperation project between China and Cambodia under the BRI. The SSEZ, which is led by garment and textile industries, houses 170 firms and has created nearly 30,000 jobs for locals.,This year marks the 65th anniversary of bilateral ties between China and Cambodia. The two countries have established a comprehensive strategic partnership of cooperation. Hun Sen's visit will demonstrate the strong relations between Cambodia and China based on a long-held traditional friendship. Since Cambodia and China established diplomatic relations in July 1958, subsequent generations of Chinese leaders have forged a profound friendship with late Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk over the decades, laying the foundation for the close relationship between the two countries for a long time to come.,China's trade and economic ties with Cambodia are broad, deep, as well as strategically oriented. According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of China, the bilateral trade volume between China and Cambodia reached $13.67 billion in 2021, a year-on-year increase of 43.1 percent. The China-Cambodia free trade agreement, which came into effect on January 1, 2022, is the first bilateral free trade arrangement signed by Cambodia. China is Cambodia's largest trading partner.,Cambodia has emerged as one of the fastest growing economies among ASEAN countries for the past decade. With its rapid economic growth and urbanization and its dynamic young population, Cambodia has become a hotspot for foreign investors, including Chinese companies. According to ASEAN Secretariat statistics, Cambodia is shining brightly as a fast-growing economic star in Southeast Asia, with an average growth rate of 7.1 percent between 2010 and 2019.,China has also been Cambodia's largest source of foreign investment since 2013. According to a report by the Council for the Development of Cambodia, Cambodia received $2.32 billion from China in 2021, up by 67 percent compared to the corresponding figure of $1.39 billion in 2020. This signals that the COVID-19 pandemic has not affected the inflow of Chinese investment to Cambodia. China accounted for 21.8 percent of total approved foreign direct investment to Cambodia from 1994 to 2019. In June 2021, the Cambodian firm Cellcard chose ZTE, a Chinese telecommunication equipment provider, as its 5G partner.,Tourism is one of the pillar industries of Cambodia's economy. In 2019, Cambodia's tourism revenue was $4.92 billion, contributing 12.1 percent to Cambodia's GDP. Cambodia is a country with an ancient civilization, and the ""Khmer civilization"" attracts tourists from all over the world with its unique charm. Cambodia is rich in natural and cultural tourism resources, including Angkor Wat and the Angkor Dynasty ruins complex in northern Cambodia, the Grand Palace of the capital, and Sihanoukville in the southwest, which is famed for its turquoise sea and white sandy beaches.,China was the biggest source of inbound foreign tourists arriving in Cambodia during the pre-pandemic era. Nonetheless, the Cambodian economy and its tourism sector were hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has implemented policies to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 on businesses and people's incomes and to support economic recovery. ,Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen's visit to China in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic won praise from the Chinese government and the Chinese. It lays the foundation for attracting Chinese tourists after the pandemic and resuming Cambodia's domestic tourism industry. Following China's recent reopening, it's expected that over one million Chinese tourists would visit Cambodia in 2023, compared to merely 110,000 in 2022.,Given its small economic and population size, foreign trade and investment have played a crucial role in boosting Cambodia's economy. Chinese investment will continue to be an important source of Cambodia's local economic growth."

To be able to beat her is so special."",Zhu followed the amazing run in New Zealand with another sensational performance in the Australia Open, where she reached her first ever round of 16 appearance at a Grand Slam with an incredible win over world No.6 Maria Sakkari. It was her first triumph against a top 10 player. ,She then pushed former world No.1 Victoria Azarenka to three sets and ultimately lost by a small margin in a two hours, 40 minutes marathon.,""She never gave up, no matter what the score was,"" observed Azarenka in reference to Zhu. ""With this tennis, she has to be in the top 20, because she played amazing. I'd never heard of her before, I know she's coming from China."" ,Now, Zhu finally lived up to her promise with her maiden career title and stormed into the top 50 for the first time. If she keeps up this momentum, it won't be long before the whole world knows the Chinese ace's name. "

Norway eyes more green cooperation with China in post-COVID era,"

    13:11, 07-Feb-2023

            ","Norway is looking for more cooperation in sustainable technologies, such as electric vehicles and batteries, with China as the two countries head toward a common greener and more sustainable future in the post-COVID era.,China and Norway have always had close cooperation in the fields of fishing, maritime and oil and gas industries. However, the pandemic caused some interruptions in their traditional areas of cooperation due to factory closures and diminished international travel due to coronavirus containment measures, said Finn Kr. Aamodt, director of Invest in Norway under Innovation Norway. ,Now that the pandemic is behind the two countries, Aamodt said that it's very promising to look at future cooperation, especially in green technologies. He specifically emphasized on batteries used in electric vehicles. ,China and Norway have been strengthening cooperation in the field of electric vehicles in recent years. Many of the iconic and newly launched EV brands of China, which is currently the world's largest electric vehicle maker, have chosen Norway to be their first stop to the European market due to Norway's 2025 target of zero emissions for all new passenger cars and its tax incentives for electric vehicle buyers., ,""Here in Norway, you see a lot of Chinese EV brands (on the street), those cars are driven by batteries, and the whole value chain is also quite important,"" said Aamodt. ""We need more batteries to be sustainable within this new way of transport, by car, also by ships and later on by plane,"" he added.,""As of today, a lot of the raw materials, the expertise and the science are all from China. I think there is a big opportunity for China, Norway and Europe to collaborate on future battery evolvement, to develop more efficient batteries and in recycling, and put those into both Chinese and European cars,"" said Aamodt.,China is currently leading the world in terms of battery cell manufacturing capacity. It produced 893 GWh of battery cells in 2022 globally, accounting for 77 percent of global production capacity. The country is also responsible for 80 percent of global battery raw material processing, according to statistics from Bloomberg New Energy Finance.,Within Europe, according to predictions offered by Benchmark Minerals, based on the announced projects, China will have 322 GWh of production capacity by 2031, followed by South Korea at 192 GWh. Norway ranks the seventh, with capacity expected to reach 69 GWh.,Europe's constraints in increasing the capacity mainly lie in its dependency on resources from other countries, such as the Democratic Republic of Congo's cobalt or Russia's nickel. Norway has plans to address the minerals' dependency by allowing seabed mining in its own waters since January 2021, but it's contested and not recommended by the EU.,Aamodt pointed out that the upstream materials are one of the areas that China and Norway could cooperate on. ""China is very much advanced in this area, and some of the production should be in Europe, because of the car industry here,"" he said.,""Having our power mostly green – its either hydropower or wind – will reduce a lot of the carbon footprint that you will see on cars. So, I think with a combination of Chinese expertise, combined with what Norway has to offer in terms of cheap energy, and also very good engineers and very efficient way of producing, I think that's very good (combination),"" Aamodt said.,However, with the drastic electricity price rise in 2021, Norway maybe losing one of the competitive advantage of having cheap electricity. ,Aamodt said that the current electricity price hike is definitely a hurdle, but it's still quite favorable to its competitors in Europe, and there are predictions that the electricity price in Norway will come down a little, and Norway has plans to further expand electricity capacity, such as by building wind farms.,Norway launched its first battery strategy in June 2022, with the goal to build Norway into an attractive host country for profitable activity throughout the battery value chain. It is aiming to ensure the provision of capital, loans and guarantees that trigger private capital as well as suitable sites and other infrastructure.,China and Norway both have set clear goals for achieving carbon neutrality, and under this common goal, there are a lot of other areas and industries that China and Norway could cooperate in on top of electric cars and batteries, Aamodt said. He concluded that there will be greening of other industries, such as in maritime shipping or steel production, and it will present a lot of cooperation opportunities in the future.,""I don't know what's going to happen, new areas will arise, but I think as long as we have the common goal to look at opportunities together, that's what makes things happen,"" said Aamodt.,""We both have good understandings of technology, and we are both very innovative, in some areas we have more power, and China has a lot of scaling abilities that we miss, I think it's a good combination for future collaboration."",Aamodt also called for more cooperation with China in other technological areas, such as building data centers and digital twins for different industries, which are areas Norway tries to develop as part of its national strategy and somewhat coincide with China's development plan for big data industry."

Versatile artist blends tradition with innovation,"

    16:28, 07-Feb-2023

            ","It's hard to clearly define if the paintings of Zhang Zikang are abstract or realistic. Zhang, director of the Art Museum of the Central Academy of Fine Arts (CAFA), said his art style has constantly evolved over the course of his art career.,""I have always believed that abstraction and realism are derived from human cognition. For example, when we're able to recognize what we see, we think it is a realistic painting. If it goes beyond our visual cognition, or it's incomprehensible, it will be regarded as abstract,"" Zhang Zikang explained. ""When we observe our world rationally, there are so many things that are beyond our recognition. But these in fact help to create a new space for art."",Zhang Zikang has been practicing traditional Chinese painting for many years. He learned realism at school, but he later realized it would be difficult to create his own style if he remained bound to tradition.,Fortunately, he entered the publishing industry after graduation, and then he worked in a number of art museums. Since 2004, Zhang has served as curator of the Today Art Museum, deputy curator of the National Art Museum of China, and is currently the director of the CAFA Art Museum. All of these experiences, which have helped broaden his perspective on art, have an indirect but substantial influence on his paintings.,""It looks as if I painted it with water and ink, but in fact, I used oil paints. It is mixed with oil and it's different from water and ink,"" said Zhang while introducing one of his most recent works. ""Because water and ink have a more delicate visual effect, I wanted more direct and intense lines. So when I painted this way, the lines have a stronger effect."",In addition to combining oil-painting techniques with traditional Chinese painting methods, Zhang Zikang likes to mix various materials together, such as toners and various kinds of colloidal substances. ""This is nothing new, as we can see blended gouache paintings, oil paintings, watercolor paintings, sketches and toners in Chagall's work,"" he said, referring to the early modernist Russian-French artist Marc Chagall.,In 2020, Zhang curated the first solo exhibition of Chagall's works in China. ""This eclectic approach to materials does bring a novelty to our paintings,"" Zhang said, noting how innovative methods help artists break the rules. ""I think a good artist must be willing to try something different,"" he added.,""Although I studied Western oil painting techniques, when my paintings are exhibited overseas, people always think they're artworks by a Chinese artist and that they are Eastern,"" Zhang recalled, ""maybe it's in my blood."",Zhang Zikang believes the contemporary era demands constant innovation, that artists create new room for our imagination, and that our understanding of art is constantly expanding. ""So art today, in terms of its function, stands for a kind of creativity,"" he noted.,When it comes to tradition and innovation, Chinese artists are constantly expanding the scope of their work through traditional art. They never stop thinking about the relationship between traditional art and the needs of the present. Zhang Zikang believes long-held customs will keep evolving through constant exchanges and self-improvement. He says that the significance of tradition relies on today's innovations forming the conventions of the future."

The answer of course, is Sichuan in southwest China - a province that's absolutely bursting with often-overlooked natural wonders.,Home to cuddly giant pandas, golden snub-nosed monkeys, vast bamboo groves and host of other plants and animals, Sichuan's rich biodiversity owes much to its complex geology. Thanks to the clash of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates that caused the elevation of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau uplift, Sichuan is a vast basin dotted and criss-crossed with mountains and valleys - a truly ""three-dimensional ecological tapestry"" that has made it a paradise for all lovers of the natural world.,The six-part documentary , offers a panoramic view of Sichuan’s magnificent natural landscapes and its varied flora and fauna. It’s a series in which viewers get to visit the Ruoergai Wetland - one of the world’s largest alpine marshlands - to observe its landscape of blooming flowers and the soaring black-necked cranes that call it home. At the other end of the scale, we see the largest ancient ice cap in the Hengduan Mountains - the origin of the many lakes, large and small, that glitter across the Sichuan landscape. Going to the southern fastnesses of the province, it's easy to see why many regard the province as a 'sea of bambo'’!,Of course, it would be impossible to do true justice to the natural charms of Sichuan in one documentary series. Nevertheless, it's a series, that thanks to the ingenuity of its production team, does manage to showcase the essence of this ""land of abundance"". Not only does it offer viewers a positive feast of the province's natural glories, it also lets people in on the inside story behind this present-day natural paradise: Sichuan's unstinting efforts in the field of conservation and ecological civilization construction. It's this that accounts for such triumphs as the reclassification of the giant panda's ecological status from “endangered” to merely “vulnerable”. And now, as ecological function of the Yangtze River basin is gradually being restored, Sichuan is resuming its place at the very heart of China's biodiversity.,All in all, this is a documentary series in which ecological civilization construction and biodiversity protection take center stage, highlighting the commitment of the Chinese people to transforming the earth into a beautiful home for the whole of humanity. As we are poignantly reminded in the last part of the documentary: “Just as rivers always flow, humans' respect for nature should never cease.”,Tune in to CGTN Documentary to watch , and be amazed by the ecological wonders of Sichuan!,Click the link below to watch the full documentary:"
Key facts U.S. deliberately ignores about African debt,"

    18:54, 07-Feb-2023

            ","Like many senior U.S. officials who have visited Africa, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen did not fail to target China and raise concerns about China's role in the debt problem during a recent visit to the continent.,While hyping up the bizarre ""Chinese debt trap,"" the U.S. officials deliberately ignored some key facts about African debt.,According to the World Bank's International Debt Statistics, multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold nearly three-quarters of Africa's total external debt.,A report published last July by the British NGO Debt Justice showed that 12 percent of the external debt of African countries is owed to Chinese lenders, compared to 35 percent to Western private lenders. The average interest rate of these private loans is 5 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for loans from Chinese public and private lenders.,""Western leaders blame China for debt crises in Africa, but this is a distraction. The truth is their own banks, asset managers and oil traders are far more responsible, but the G7 (the Group of Seven) are letting them off the hook,"" said Tim Jones, head of policy at Debt Justice.,In Chad, for example, the Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company Glencore possesses about one-third of the country's external debt, while for Zambia, the American multinational investment company BlackRock is a major creditor, reported the French daily newspaper Le Monde on January 30.,While calling for immediately addressing Zambia's heavy debt burden with China, Yellen deliberately ignored the fact that multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors hold most of the country's external debt.,According to figures released by Zambia's Ministry of Finance and Planning, multilateral financial institutions account for 24 percent of the country's foreign debt, while predominantly Western commercial lenders account for 46 percent.,""Western lenders for long have not been put on the spotlight for debt relief because they successfully managed to dupe the world that it's only Chinese lenders that pose a threat to Africa,"" Uganda-based Vision Group journalist Mubarak Mugabo said.,The causes of the debt crisis are multifaceted: the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, a decline in global economic growth and economic structure vulnerabilities, among many other things, could all exacerbate the debt situation of some African countries.,Persistent inflation, prolonged tightening of global financial conditions, the high cost of capital, domestic currency depreciation and lower financial inflows could increase the risks of debt distress in some African countries, according to Africa's Macroeconomic Performance and Outlook published in January 2023 by the African Development Bank (AfDB).,In particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate hikes and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar have greatly added to the debt service burden of African countries, the AfDB pointed out. For example, Ghana's currency, the cedi, depreciated more than 33.4 percent against the U.S. dollar in 2022.,Since most of the debt that emerging and low-income countries should be paid in a foreign currency, notably the U.S. dollar and Euro, irresponsible U.S.-government policies have added fuel to the fire.,In contrast, China has been an ardent supporter of the Group of 20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative. The country has signed agreements or reached consensus with 19 African countries on debt relief and has suspended the most debt service payments of any G20 member. China has also actively addressed the debt of Chad, Ethiopia and Zambia on a case-by-case basis within the G20 framework.,""They depict China as a predatory lender that is weaponizing capital in order to practice a new form of colonialism in Africa. However, such accusations have little factual basis,"" noted Costantinos Bt. Costantinos, professor of public policy at the Addis Ababa University in Ethiopia.,""The debt trap issue has been a political smear,"" said Charles Onunaiju, director of the Nigeria-based Center for China Studies, adding that such claims are just a red herring to absolve the West of any responsibility.,During trips to Africa, American officials may not have realized that when they disembarked from a plane, they were likely headed toward a terminal built by a Chinese company. And their cars were also driving on roads or bridges built by a Chinese contractor. Modern infrastructure built by China is ubiquitous across Africa.,The increase in debt stock could also be a positive sign, and not just a pathology, according to an article published in June last year on the website of The Africa Report. Many sub-Saharan African economies experienced record growth before the pandemic. When gross domestic product increases, it is normal for debt to follow.,Suppose external debt contributes to a country's economic and social development in the long term and can be adequately managed. In that case, it could be called good debt, or in other words, financial aid for development.,Therefore, debt growth is only a trivial aspect of the problem. The rub is how to help African countries achieve sustainable, independent and high-quality development resulting in a balance of development financing and debt growth.,""China's financial assistance to Africa is largely aimed at realizing socio-economic and cultural projects of great importance, such as road infrastructure, hospitals, schools, bridges, etc.,"" Amadou Diop, a Senegalese expert on China, told Xinhua.,Statistics showed that since the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation was founded almost 23 years ago, Chinese companies have built or upgraded more than 10,000 kilometers of railways, nearly 100,000 kilometers of roads, roughly 1,000 bridges and 100 ports, and several hospitals and schools in Africa, creating more than 4.5 million jobs.,Published last July by a fellow in South Africa's University of Fort Hare, a quantitative study of the impact of China's loans on growth in 15 African countries concluded that China's efforts in developing infrastructure translate into economic growth.,According to the study, China has been and continues to be a significant force in assisting African countries in financing their development.,A survey issued last year by the Inter Region Economic Network, a Kenya-based think tank, found that China takes a substantial lead in decision-making and timely completion of infrastructure projects such as roads, power dams, railways and bridges in Africa. Facts and figures in the study showed that through efficient action, China tangibly contributes to Africa's development.,""There is a common feeling among African countries,"" said Ezzat Saad, director of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, ""that China is a reliable partner, and there is a great trust and credibility in China-Africa cooperation."""

The number of orders for overseas hotels and international flights booked by Chinese tourists in the mainland increased by more than four times from last year.,After China lifted cross-border restrictions earlier last month, Han Hongmei's family immediately set off for a two-week vacation in Dubai.,Han decided to travel abroad after she and her son recovered from the COVID-19 infection at the end of last December. Han's husband is working in Dubai and she thought it was a good opportunity for her 5-year-old son to experience different cultures in the world.  ,Chinese tourists are granted landing visa for 30 days at the port of entry in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.,""My son was super excited when we were climbing the Burj Khalifa Tower,"" said Han. ""We didn't set a clear limit on how much we could spend for this vacation. The ultimate goal was to have fun together, eating, drinking and touring."",Chinese tourists were known for their lavish spending habits in the world's tourism market before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of outbound travels and the amount of expenditure were ranked first in the world in 2019, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS).,About 155 million outbound trips were made by Chinese tourists in 2019, NBS said. Chinese tourists spent $255 billion overseas that year, accounting for almost one-fifth of global tourism spending, according to UN's World Tourism Organization.,Guo Ruigang, a sales consultant with China International Travel Service Shenzhen, also noticed that outbound travel is picking up.,The 36-year-old has been working in the tourism industry for 12 years, focusing on outbound tours. He said the COVID-19 has dealt an unprecedented blow to the business in the past three years.,To protect people's lives and health, China suspended all group tours in January 2020 and individual travel abroad was limited to business or education purposes.,""In order to reduce losses, our company has made every effort to develop domestic tourism, but it's really tough,"" said Guo.,Guo hopes that the tourism industry can return to pre-pandemic levels soon, as the country resumes more outbound travels.,Compared to 2019, the contribution of outbound tourism in travel agencies' revenue dropped from over 30 percent in 2019 to less than 0.5 percent in 2021, according to the latest report on China's outbound tourism development released by China Tourism Academy last December.,The report estimates that over 400 million Chinese tourists could've traveled abroad, spending between $340 billion and $430 billion, from 2020 to 2022.,Tang Xiaoyun, vice president of China Tourism Academy, said that it takes time for the outbound group tour market to recover.,""At present, air ticket prices are relatively high. Due to disruptions of supply chains, prices of accommodation and catering are also at a high level, so there is still a long way to go for tourists to regain their confidence in traveling abroad,"" Tang told CMG.,Many staff left the tourism industry in the past three years due to plummeted income. In Guo's company, the outbound tour business totally stopped during this period. Both travel agencies and companies in China and abroad need to attract them back into the industry or train new staff.,Tang also pointed out travel agencies need to prepare new travel products when more international flights are available and destination countries need to restore their local services by rebuilding supply chains."

Does Türkiye's earthquake have any connection with China's earthquakes?,"

            ","The earthquake that devastated the area of Türkiye and north-west Syria on Monday morning is believed to be the most severe one since the 1939 earthquake which struck the eastern part of Türkiye.,Following the earthquake, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) determined that the epicenter was located at the intersection of three tectonic plates: the Arabian, Anatolian, and African plates. Under this circumstance, many believe such a huge earthquake represents the increasing activity of tectonic plate movement, and therefore worry about if this earthquake has any connection with the previous earthquakes that happened in China, including the 4.3-magnitude earthquake that happened near south China's Taiwan Province on February 7, and several small earthquakes happened in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Ji Jianqing, a professor at the School of Earth and Space Sciences at Peking University, shared his opinion about these doubts and worries.,Professor Ji indicated that the earthquakes which occurred in China recently are normal activities of tectonic plate movements, and there is no evidence showing that these earthquakes have any relation to the Türkiye 7.8-magnitude earthquake. He also pointed out that big earthquakes usually cause public misunderstandings of seismicity—the distribution of earthquakes in space, time and magnitude, might increase rapidly.

People practice the art as a profession, he noted. ""I think it's more touching when artworks are expressed truthfully, from the bottom of our hearts."",With more than two decades' experience working at the National Museum of China, Xie is well aware of how the many cultural relics he encountered nourished his artistic growth, sometimes in barely perceptible ways, ""when I pick up the brush to paint, something magical flows naturally from the tip of my brush at any time,"" he explained.,""In my opinion, calligraphy plays a very special role in the historical development of Chinese culture. Since the birth of the Chinese characters, or even before that, these kinds of engraving symbols had an innate aesthetic power. Therefore, Chinese calligraphy will always be linked to the development of Chinese culture,"" he said.,From oracle bone and bronze inscriptions to official or regular script and Chinese stone rubbings, calligraphy represents an evolution of these aesthetic forms. It also serves as an important cultural code in Chinese civilization. ""Especially now, we should say we are more and more aware of its importance in Chinese cultural heritage,"" Xie said.,Besides calligraphy, rubbings and epigraphy are key means of studying and inheriting Chinese culture. Many historic events, including King Wu's conquest over King Zhou, were recorded in inscriptions found on bronze-ware artifacts. ""So rubbing was a very effective way for ancient Chinese to learn and study, duplicate and preserve these historical sites and evidence,"" Xie said, noting the fact that many original tablets have disappeared, yet the rubbings remain. The technique of ink rubbing has existed since the Tang Dynasty(618-907), but it matured during the Song Dynasty(960-1279).,In fact, a large number of pottery and ceramic styles, bricks and tiles fall into this category of epigraphy, a complex subject. During the interview, Xie introduced a brick engraved with an important title from the ninth year of the Emperor Yonghe (353 CE).,""That's when Wang Xizhi wrote the 'Preface of the Orchid Pavilion,' so it was an important year in the history of calligraphy,"" he said.,When it comes to cultural inheritance, Xie has his own opinion. ""Tradition and innovation in my mind indicate a kind of causality,"" he said. ""No tradition, no innovation. I don't agree with the kind of innovation that's completely removed from tradition. This is certainly true in the field of calligraphy. If you don't practice and imitate different kinds of traditional script forms and famous works, and instead jump straight into trying to innovate, your work will be overshadowed by your lack of training."",""But of course, if you completely abide by tradition, you will never make a breakthrough,"" Xie added. ""You need to create something innovative using tradition as a foundation. In doing so, tradition brings extra vitality."""

The successes of China and the U.S. represent opportunities rather than challenges to each other and the entire earth can fully support the development and common prosperity of both China and the U.S.,She added that China is not afraid of competition, but China does oppose defining the whole China-U.S. relations by competition, smearing China in the name of competition, and restricting China's legitimate development rights even at the expense of global industrial and supply chains, which is not what a responsible great power should do.,In his speech, Biden also referred to the latest airship accident, in which a Chinese civil airship, mainly for meteorological purposes, affected by the Westerlies, deviated from its planned course and entered U.S. airspace, saying if China ""threatens"" its sovereignty, the U.S. will act to protect its country.,After China was informed of the entry of the Chinese airship, Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, during which Wang called on the U.S. side to handle the unexpected situation in a ""cool-headed and professional manner,"" while the U.S. then shot down the unmanned airship, disregarding China's repeated claims that the accidental entry is a force majeure and poses no threat to U.S. personnel or national security.,Mao noted that a sound and stable China-U.S. relationship serves the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is also the shared aspiration of the international community. China will handle China-U.S. relations in accordance with the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation, and at the same time, China will also firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests.,""The U.S. should have an objective and rational understanding of China, pursue a positive and pragmatic policy towards China, and work with China to bring China-U.S. relations back to the track of sound and stable development,"" Mao said."
Aging well: China has all it takes to become a top destination for senior tourism,"

    19:01, 08-Feb-2023

            ","China is witnessing a massive boom in both domestic and outbound tourism following the lifting of COVID-19 travel restrictions. With its aging population steeply rising, China is also at the cusp of becoming a top destination for elderly-friendly tourism in the coming years.,As low fertility and increasing longevity drive rapid aging, the world is set to become a super-aging society in the coming decades triggering unforeseen growth in the global senior tourism segment. For instance, in 1999, over 593 million international travelers were elderly people (those aged 60 years and above), which accounted for around a third of holiday spending. This number is projected to reach two billion trips annually by 2050, according to the World Tourism Organization.,It is estimated that seniors will comprise nearly a quarter of the world's population by 2050, compared to only 10 percent in 2000. Meaning that they will be responsible for more holiday spending in the future than all of the younger age groups combined. China, with its demographic composition, will be among the largest contributors to global senior tourism.,China's aging level is already above the global average. The country is approaching a ""moderately aging"" scenario, in which 20 percent of its population is comprised of elderly people. According to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China, by 2021, the number of elderly people reached 267 million, about 18.9 percent of the country's population. These figures are expected to exceed 300 million and 20 percent in 2025 and 400 million and 30 percent in 2035, respectively. ,Meanwhile, the appetite for tourism in China remains robust as witnessed in recent weeks. More than 300 million trips were taken across China during the Spring Festival holidays, aptly known as the Golden Week. And, on Monday, China resumed outbound group travel after a three-year pandemic-induced suspension, which is expected to give a much-needed boost to global tourism.,Before the pandemic, China had emerged as the world's largest outbound tourism market. In 2019 alone, about 155 million Chinese tourists spent $245 billion traveling across the world, according to a study by New York-headquartered consulting firm Oliver Wyman. If the recent tourism surge is any indication, China is set to reclaim that slot and, in good part, due to a large number of senior travelers from the country.,Although China's population aging began somewhat late, it is now large-scale, fast, and regionally uneven. Negative domestic population growth in 2022 pointed to a complex situation: the country is facing issues with pensions, consumption, economic crisis, and so on. In preparation for this demographic shift and its negative impacts, China has explored feasible paths to healthy aging since 1999, when the country officially became an aging society.,Two decades of effort have brought China fruitful achievements in healthy aging; the country has mapped out a timely and evidence-based path. Addressing population aging is a national strategy. China has established a system in which population, social, and economic policies are intertwined. Given general patterns of population development and aging, two broad strategies have prevailed: deferral strategies and adaptation strategies. ,Deferral strategies aim to slow population aging as much as possible. China has loosened birth restrictions, from the one-child policy to the three-child policy, to encourage more births. It has also assembled a maternity support policy package covering education, housing, health care, employment, and so forth. Because population aging is inevitable, China is also pursuing adaptation strategies to build a strong economic foundation and an aging-friendly social environment.,On the one hand, China has striven to develop a high-quality social security system to care for the elderly. The country's multi-tiered, multi-pillar old-age insurance structure includes basic endowment insurance, an enterprise annuity, and individual savings–funded endowment insurance. China has the world's largest social security network as of 2022 – 95 percent of residents had basic medical insurance, and basic endowment insurance covered 1.04 billion people.,The country has also developed an old-age service system that is based on home care, supported by community care, supplemented by institutional care, and combined with medical care. Societal infrastructure has been retrofitted to be elderly-oriented; technology is being adopted to promote ""smart"" senior care as well.,On the other hand, China has harnessed the synergy between aging and industry to give the elderly a sense of worthiness. For instance, people aged between 60 and 69 years accounted for 55.83 percent of China's total 60-plus-year-old population in 2020, and many were able and willing to work. China has tapped its senior human resources through retirement age delays and the ""Silver Age Action"" campaign. A silver economy has also unleashed the aging population's consumption potential while offering products and services to market segments such as the poor, the masses, and high-income earners.,Healthy aging is a global initiative that requires a concerted effort across social sectors. Tourism, as a pillar industry of the world economy, is an integral part of this complex ecosystem. Relatively more leisure time and disposable income make the aging population an important segment. Especially in China, senior tourism has become a key contributor to the silver economy and a potential impetus for post-pandemic tourism recovery.,Seniors accounted for more than 20 percent of all Chinese tourists as of 2020. Their travel consumption grew by 23 percent annually between 2016 and 2020. Senior Chinese tourists' total consumption surpassed 700 billion yuan (about $103 billion) in 2021 and is projected to top 2.4 trillion yuan ($350 billion) by 2050.,Tourism may also serve as a promising non-pharmacological therapy to improve people's health and well-being. This prospect is particularly meaningful for aging populations, who are vulnerable to sub-optimal health and non-communicable diseases. Productive travel experiences – including physical activity, positive emotions, socialization, and healthy eating – can play a part in health promotion. ,The fact is that the world is getting older. Being a country where great importance is placed on respecting elders, China is already popular with senior travelers. With powerful policy and financial support, China is committed to cultivating senior tourism and improving service quality to meet the elderly's needs and protect their rights.,China has taken numerous steps to create an aging-friendly society. It has also made efforts to develop elderly-friendly infrastructures and features such as wheelchair-accessible ramps and lifts at popular tourist attractions and heritage sites. China also offers a range of cultural activities such as learning calligraphy or traditional art, learning basic Chinese cooking, a variety of cultural and art performances and shows that are very popular among elderly travelers.,The ""China model"" of preparing to embrace an aging population is the key to elderly-friendly tourism and should serve as an inspiration for other countries."

Master stroke: one calligrapher's brush with history,"

    13:16, 09-Feb-2023

            ","As a veteran researcher and calligrapher, Xie Xiaoquan is now working at the China National Academy of Painting. ""In the olden days, Chinese artists would always create a piece of calligraphy after having a get-together, like the 'Preface of the Orchid Pavilion,' for instance,"" said Xie. The situation is quite different today.,People practice the art as a profession, he noted. ""I think it's more touching when artworks are expressed truthfully, from the bottom of our hearts."" ,With more than two decades of experience working at the National Museum of China, Xie is well aware of how the many cultural relics he encountered that nourished his artistic growth, sometimes in barely perceptible ways, ""when I pick up the brush to paint, something magical flows naturally from the tip of my brush at any time,"" he explained.,""In my opinion, calligraphy plays a very special role in the historical development of Chinese culture. Since the birth of the Chinese characters, or even before, these kinds of engraving symbols have had an innate aesthetic power. Therefore, Chinese calligraphy will always be linked to the development of Chinese culture,"" he said. ,From oracle bones and bronze inscriptions to official or regular script and Chinese stone rubbings, calligraphy represents an evolution of these aesthetic forms. It also serves as an important cultural code in Chinese civilization. ""Especially now, we should say we are more and more aware of its importance in Chinese cultural heritage,"" Xie said.,Besides calligraphy, rubbings, and epigraphy are key means of studying and inheriting Chinese culture. Many historical events, including King Wu's conquest over King Zhou, were recorded in inscriptions found on bronze-ware artifacts. ""So rubbing was a very effective way for ancient Chinese to learn and study, duplicate and preserve these historical sites and evidence,"" Xie said, noting the fact that many original tablets have disappeared, yet the rubbings remain. The technique of ink rubbing has existed since the Tang Dynasty (618-907), but it matured during the Song Dynasty (960-1279).,In fact, a large number of pottery and ceramic styles, bricks, and tiles fall into this category of epigraphy, a complex subject. During the interview, Xie displayed a brick engraved with an important title from the ninth year of Emperor Yonghe (353 CE).,""That's when Wang Xizhi wrote the 'Preface of the Orchid Pavilion,' so it was an important year in the history of calligraphy,"" he said.,When it comes to cultural inheritance, Xie has his own opinion. ""Tradition and innovation, in my mind, indicate a kind of causality,"" he said. ""No tradition, no innovation. I disagree with the kind of innovation that's completely removed from tradition. This is certainly true in the field of calligraphy. If you don't practice and imitate different kinds of traditional script forms and famous works and instead jump straight into trying to innovate, your work will be overshadowed by your lack of training."",""But of course, if you completely abide by tradition, you will never make a breakthrough,"" Xie added. ""You need to create something innovative using tradition as a foundation. In doing so, tradition brings extra vitality."""

Now in her 30s, Lowdermilk says she doesn't like to think about leaving. China is her home and the place that makes her happy.,As Lowdermilk's life in China flourished, she not only incorporated the Chinese language in her songs, but also chose Tang Bohu as a stage name, inspired by one of the great Ming Dynasty poets. ,""After learning more about Tang Bohu, he fought through so much. I think if it happened to a regular person, he or she would just be like, never mind. I'm not going to do this anymore. In this poem, he said, I would rather live my life penniless and die under a tree somewhere than to bow down in front of basically society or money. So, I decided to keep this name because I think it's a kind of like 'Jing Shen' (Attitude), it's a kind of attitude. And no matter what happens, no matter if the world recognizes you or not, always stick to what you feel, what you believe, your art, fight for it,"" Lowdermilk said.,Lowdermilk rose to fame in China after taking part in a popular talent competition in 2013.

But the thing that I always keep coming back to is ""Yun Wei"" (Lingering Charm). And one reason why I like Chinese opera so much is because it's very crucial to Chinese opera. I have a song called Qing Si, which is my favorite. It's actually very sad, but a lot of people think it's a happy song. It's not a love song. It's a very sad song. We put it to more electronic music and kept some of the singing like the Beijing opera styles, it works together very well.

It's a very straightforward song, but the melody makes it timeless. It's a lot like inner Mongolian influences and some kinds of like 'Cao Yuan Ge Qu' (Grasslands Song) like music from the grasslands has similar similarities to Irish and like Scottish. We added a little bit like a touch of this kind of Chinese opera style of singing,"" Lowdermilk said.,Lowdermilk explains that it was her passion for music that helped her reach where she is today. ""When I first started singing this kind of music, it wasn't an effort to become famous or to make other people like it, it was just I enjoyed it. If I have a new song, I will send it to my mum, and she will send it to my grandma. So, I think the most important thing is that I stick to doing it from the heart. That I respect music and I do my best to make it sound as beautiful as I can,"" said Lowdermilk.,Lowdermilk's worldly experiences have shaped her unique outlook that shines through in her music."

China's first homegrown life support device with rocket tech hits market,"

            ","China's first domestically-developed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device ""Revive-I,"" powered by rocket technology, that potentially provides critically ill COVID-19 patients a shot at survival, was launched in Beijing on Wednesday.,An ECMO device is a type of artificial heart and lung machine that provides prolonged cardiac and respiratory support to a patient outside the body.,Typically used in open-heart surgery, the use of ECMOs skyrocketed during the COVID-19 epidemic. It was hailed as a ""miracle machine"" as reports of severe COVID-19 patients surviving thanks to its use made front-page news.,Scientists from Rocket-Medical, a subsidiary company under the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, the country's leading rocket maker, started developing the ECMO machine in 2020 after the COVID-19 outbreak.,The core technology of the ECMO system is derived from a rocket's servomechanism, said Xu Jian, chief engineer of the project.,A servomechanism is a device used to provide control during an operation through the use of feedback. Servo motors on a rocket can help manipulate and fix its positions, directions, and paths during flight.,""ECMO components such as the oxygenator and centrifugal pump involve magnetic levitation and motor control technologies, which work similarly to a rocket's servomechanism,"" Xu explained.,Compared with foreign brands, the patented Chinese ECMO is lighter and easily movable, said Zeng Si, director of the research project. It weighs less than 7.5 kg, only one-third of the weight of similar foreign products, and it is light enough to be transported in an ambulance, making it possible to provide ECMO support in emergencies.,Many big hospitals in Beijing and Tianjin took part in the project, offering clinical suggestions and carrying out human trials.,""We used it on seven severe cases. The longest ECMO run time was 25 days,"" said Weng Li, a clinician at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. ""Its operating system is more intuitive."",China's ECMO machine market is dominated by foreign brands. An imported machine is priced between 1.5 million yuan (about $221,300) and 3.5 million yuan. Xu said the price of the Revive-I will be a third to a quarter lower than that of foreign products.,The high cost of an ECMO device usually makes it unaffordable. Generally, the cost of two weeks of ECMO treatment is 100,000 yuan, making it one of the most costly medical procedures.,The domestically-developed ECMO system will offer more access to advanced life support equipment in the country and help reduce the burden of medical treatment for patients, Xu added.,The National Medical Products Administration, China's top drug regulator, has recently issued emergency use authorization for the Revive-I, which is the second domestically-developed ECMO device approved for public sale. The first one was developed by Shenzhen-based Chinabridge Medical.,The COVID-19 epidemic has intensified competition for ECMO manufacturing. Many universities and medical technology companies across China have made investments in ECMO machine development over the past three years.,In September 2020, China's Ministry of Science and Technology announced it would invest 20 million yuan to support domestic research and development.,(With input from Xinhua)"

Echoes of the Tang Dynasty: a masterpiece comes to life through dance,"

    16:00, 10-Feb-2023

            ","In Chinese, ""Dao"" is a verb meaning ""pound."" ""Lian"" is a raw silk woven product with white color. In ancient China, the process of turning raw silk fabric into soft and lustrous cloth was called ""Dao Lian,"" which was regarded as a fundamental activity for women comparable to men's agricultural work. Later, the activity became a poetic image, and was commonly seen in literati's works. Among all the related paintings, ""Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk,"" by Zhang Xuan of the Tang Dynasty (618-907), is considered one of the best. It is an important painting of the Tang Dynasty, showing the scene of court ladies producing white silk. The 12 characters can be roughly divided into different groups doing one of the three procedures: pounding, sewing and ironing. Produced by China Media Group, the cultural program ""China in Poetry and Painting"" invited famous dancer Huang Lufei and dancers from the Xi'an Dance and Opera Troupe to adapt this masterpiece into a dance performance, bringing the court ladies of Tang Dynasty to life.,It is a pity that the original work by Zhang Xuan has been lost. The painting currently housed in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in the United States, is a high-quality copy rendered in the Song Dynasty. The painting portrays three groups of luxuriously-adorned court ladies working on newly woven silk. Viewing from the right, the first group of four ladies are pounding silk with wooden poles. They are depicted standing in a diamond-shaped formation, thus creating a three-dimensional element. There are only two figures in the second group. Both of them are concentrating on the threads in their hands, one sitting on the ground preparing thread and the other sewing while sitting on a stool. Different from the dynamic beauty showed by the former group, the sewing ladies project a tranquil ambiance. On the left side of the scroll is the last scene of ironing. Three court ladies are stretching out a long piece of silk cloth, which is being ironed by another lady holding a wooden-handled metal spoon. A maidservant is fanning a charcoal stove for heating the spoon. And there is a naughty child scurrying around, looking around with interest, to playfully break the monotonous atmosphere of concentration, giving the painting a lively and lyrical touch.,In the Tang Dynasty, artists witnessed a flourishing economy and a stable society. Correspondingly, figure painting reached its zenith during the prosperous years, and branched into a new genre called ""paintings of court ladies,"" which embodied the beauty of women. ""Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk"" is outstanding in its use of color. Zhang Xuan applied bright and warm colors to the ladies, echoing a magnificent and graceful aesthetic style that prevailed during the Tang Dynasty. In the painting, the 12 women are dressed in short tops, long skirts, and with shawls on their shoulders. The colors are different, yet blended and harmonized. The court ladies are elegant and plump, revealing the freedom, openness and tolerance of Tang society.,On the ""China in Poetry and Painting"" stage, as the lead dancer in red silk walks at a slow pace, a digital scroll of ""Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk"" gently unfurls itself. Accompanied by a melodious soundtrack, the 12 court ladies depicted in the masterpiece come to life through the dance performance. Through various expressions and postures, the dancers turn the cloth-making activities into elegant choreographic elements, reawakening the figures to the greatest extent. The blurred images of whirling dancers are like a kaleidoscope, reflecting the glory and the magnificent colors of the Tang Dynasty. Every twinkle and smile is bright, allowing the audience to take in the delight of the ancient fashion trends.,According to Wu Weishan, the curator of the National Art Museum of China, during the flourishing Tang Dynasty, Chang’an was the center of silk production in China. The prosperity can largely be attributed to women at that time, for whom making cloth was considered a proper occupation. ""Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk"" provides precious insight into women working at the ancient royal court. Thanks to their hard work, society was as prosperous as that depicted in the masterpiece. Today, when we look back to the Tang Dynasty and cherish the cultural legacy it left in history, we also look forward to the future, creating new works full of vitality and imagination."

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen once said China has built a lot of roads and bridges for Cambodia, so it means that China has built a lot of hope for the Cambodian people.,Hun Sen visited China in February, 2020, when the COVID-19 epidemic situation in the country was still grave. Recalling that meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday said the visit was a token of support and that Hun Sen stood firmly with the Chinese people in their fight against COVID-19.,""It gives me great pleasure to work with you to realize our three-year appointment and open a new era of building a China-Cambodia community with a shared future at the start of spring,"" Xi told Hun Sen at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing.,Xi pointed out that the two sides can build a cooperation framework in six major areas: politics, production capacity, agriculture, energy, security and people-to-people and cultural exchanges.

Is decoupling an option in the China-U.S. trade relationship? ,"

    23:50, 10-Feb-2023

            ","Ties between China and the U.S. have frayed in the last few years, generating a lot of rhetoric around the notion of economic ""decoupling."" However, that was not evident in trade figures released by the U.S. Commerce Department on Tuesday, Feb. 7, showing that trade between the two world powers has hit a record high. Can the two countries pursue a decoupling strategy?  ,Goods traded in 2022 between China and the U.S. reached $690.6 billion, according to U.S. data.  ,Experts say the rhetoric in Washington does not always correspond with what's actually happening on the ground.,“Decoupling is more evident in the political statements in Washington, DC, than in the economic reality. Companies and consumers in the United States, they really care about getting products from reliable suppliers in a timely fashion and at a competitive price,” said economics professor Yan Liang of Willamette University. ,Although the trade data is not adjusted for inflation, the numbers are still considered high.  ,The Biden administration has indicated that it hopes to build a “floor for the relationship” between the two countries.  ,The aim is to prevent the rivalry from spiraling into conflict.  ,The administration’s message was complicated by its decision to largely ban the export of semiconductor chips to China.  ,“I think to some degree this policy has a counterproductive effect of not being able to address the U.S.’s trade imbalance with China. Because if the U.S. restricts exports of high-tech products to China, that would mean they are reducing their own export revenues. That is not helpful for the United States to reduce its trade deficit with China,” said Liang. She added, “In addition, banning these exports of high-tech goods would also undermine the (U.S.) tech companies’ bottom line."" ,Former U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 launched a trade war with China.  He imposed tariffs on nearly $300 billion worth of Chinese goods, leading China to retaliate. ,But where do consumers and businesses stand? ,According to Liang, “From business and economic logic, the consumers and U.S. companies will continue to want to trade with China. At the political dimension, there is still a lot of barriers. Because of political pressure I don’t see the Biden administration changing its policy stance anytime soon, but the economic reality is that the two countries are deeply integrated, deeply connected and interdependent. So I think the trade relation will continue to forge ahead.”  ,What do you think?  "

The myth of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, also known as Niulang and Zhinyu in Chinese, remains one of the most popular. It has been passed down among generations since the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.) over 2,200 years ago.,According to ancient legend, a boy named Niulang was living a harsh life on Earth. His older brother and sister-in-law treated him badly, and he only had one friend – an old buffalo.,In heaven, Zhinyu was a young lady who was good at weaving. One day, she grew tired of her humdrum life and secretly went down to Earth. By chance, she met Niulang, and privately decided to marry him. After that, Niulang and Zhinyu lived a happy life and had two children.,When the Emperor of Heaven and the Queen Mother learned about their marriage, they were furious and ordered Zhinyu to immediately return to heaven. After Niulang heard the news, he took his children and embarked for heaven with the help of his old buffalo. For this reason, the Queen Mother took off her hairpin and ""drew"" a river to separate the couple.,However, the love story between Niulang and Zhinyu spread widely and also drew the sympathy of the magpies. A large number then came to build a ""magpie bridge"" across the river with their bodies so the couple could meet in heaven. Later, the Queen Mother was also touched by Niulang and Zhinyu's enduring romance, and agreed they could meet once a year on the 7th day of the 7th month of the Chinese lunar calendar. Every year on that date, numerous magpies would form a bridge to reunite the couple for a day.,This day was designated as the Qixi Festival, which is considered to be the most romantic and traditional festival in China. Today, it is dubbed the Chinese Valentine's Day.,The mythology of Niulang and Zhinyu has also spread to other parts of Asia, but the details differ. It has been counted as one of China's Four Great Folktales, the others being the Legend of the White Snake, Lady Meng Jiang, and The Butterfly Lovers."

Known for its sheer length, long history, universally acclaimed masonry as well as the outstanding and unique representation of serving as a military architectural ensemble, this symbolic edifice also plays a significant role in the country's literature. With its construction not only highlighting the grandiosity and sheer spectacle of such an undertaking, but also the suffering of those who toiled on it, this winding barrier has given rise to many legends, myths and tales, one of the most cherished of which is the tale of Lady Meng Jiang.,Though household folktales differ from region to region, presenting multifaceted plots, the main story remains almost the same. It involves a lost husband and a loyal wife, whose everlasting love was forcibly extinguished by the construction of the Great Wall, with the wife's grief and tears finally toppling a section of the mighty wall.,Legend has it that Lady Meng Jiang's husband was pressed into service and sent as laborer to build the Great Wall under the order of Qinshihuang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C.-207 B.C.), just three days after the couple got married.,Weeks soon turned into months, and winter descended. Having not heard any news from her beloved husband for a long time, the young wife set off, making up her mind to take it upon herself to meet her husband and bring him some warm winter clothes that she made. But the hopeful journey ended in tragedy as, upon Lady Meng Jiang's arrival at the foot of the Great Wall, she was informed her beloved had died from hard labor and was entombed somewhere under the Great Wall, along with thousands of his fellow workers.,Mired in sorrow, a heartbroken Lady Meng Jiang could not help but weep. She wailed over the Great Wall for three days and three nights, her tears of grief finally causing a section of the mighty wall to collapse, and expose her husband's remains.,According to historians, the archetype of this folktale lies in an anecdote found in Zuozhuan, or Zuo's Commentary, a chronicle of the Spring and Autumn Period (770 B.C.-476 B.C.). This classical text dates back over 2,000 years and is among the earliest Chinese works of narrative history.,The tale of Lady Meng Jiang has been counted as one of China's most famous folktales, which also include the Myth of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl, the Legend of the White Snake, and of course The Butterfly Lovers, dubbed ""China's Romeo and Juliet."""

    21:05, 12-Feb-2023

            ","Chinese modernization shares similarities to the modernization processes of all countries, but it is more characterized by features that are unique to the Chinese context.,President Xi Jinping described Chinese modernization as ""a new model for human advancement"" while addressing the opening of a study session at the Party School of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on Tuesday.,It dispels the myth that ""modernization is equal to Westernization,"" presents another picture of modernization, expands the channels for developing countries to achieve modernization, and provides a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity, Xi said.,Chinese modernization is the modernization of a huge population and of common prosperity for all, said Xi, citing the report to the 20th CPC National Congress.,An article by Xi published in the , , said the people are the foundation and lifeblood of the CPC. ""Our Party has no special interests of its own, and puts our people's interests first at all times,"" the article read.,Achieving common prosperity is a defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics, according to the report to the 20th CPC National Congress.,China announced in 2021 that the country had lifted the final 98.99 million rural residents living under the poverty line out of poverty, and removed all 832 impoverished counties and 128,000 villages from the poverty list.,UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres once commented that China's great achievements in poverty reduction constitute ""the biggest contribution for dramatical reduction of poverty."",And over the past four decades, people's lives in China have been dramatically improved.

""I'm very proud of myself and especially thanks to all the fans and my team who came here to support. I couldn't do this without any of you guys."",Wu started the much-anticipated final of the ATP 250 event playing free-flowing, attacking tennis, showcasing his sky-high confidence after coming back from a set down to upset top-seeded American Taylor Fritz in the semifinals. But he struggled to cope with Isner's ferocious serving barrage as the match fell away from him. ,The crowd's favorite could have wrapped up the game when the veteran American held championship point at 6-5, 30/40 in the second set, but Wu demonstrated a technique and composure belying his tender years to fight back from the brink before saving all three break points in the final tiebreaker to seal the historic triumph. ,""It's a tough one to lose,"" said a crestfallen Isner, who missed the glorious chance to capture his 17th title in front of the home fans. ""I don't know how many match points I had, I'm sure it's a lot. I swear I thought I won the match a few times... Sports can be brutal."",Despite the shock defeat, Isner has spoken in glowing terms about Wu, who will rise to a career-high world No. 58 after only being ranked No. 1,121 a year ago. ,""He [Wu] is an unbelievable ball-striker and a very good talent,"" said Isner. ""It's like he plays every point the same, so definitely no nerves. He gets a ball to hit, he hits it, and on this court it's hard to hit him a shot he is uncomfortable with."" ,After this thrilling victory, the hype surrounding the Hangzhou native will unquestionably go into overdrive. But every tennis enthusiast knows it's just a start. A new era is coming.,Wu summed up the mood best when he reflected on his breakthrough in the post-game press conference later in the day. ,""I think it's not only about winning the title, it's more about me personally making history and also for the country. That's huge for the next generation,"" he observed.  ,""For me, I need to keep going, keep my body healthy. I'm sure there's more to come."""

It wiped out more than 80 percent of marine species, taking its worst toll on sessile organisms in the ocean and making room for mobile ones.,But how soon the new ecosystem with a complete pyramid structure, including predators and prey, came on stage remains poorly understood due to the scarcity of well-preserved fossils, according to the study.,A group of paleontologists led by Song Haijun from China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, chanced upon a rarely-seen lobster fossil fragment in early 2015, before they started an eight-year excavation project.,Their continuous field work unveiled an unprecedented snapshot of ancient animals comprising at least 12 classes and 19 orders, revealing a complex marine ecosystem including diverse fish and crab-like animals.,The new assemblages covered multiple representative species ranging from 100-micron primary consumers to one-meter-long predatory fish, as well as abundant excrement fossils, which formed complex food chains and a complete ecological structure at that time.,The scientists used high-precision U-Pb dating and revealed that, despite a harsh marine environment, this ecosystem appeared only about 1 million years following the severe extinction event, earlier than previously believed.,It filled a three-million-year gap of complex marine faunas, according to the study.,""Although the Guiyang Biota remains incompletely sampled, it highlights that a slow and gradual recovery model does not apply to the period that followed this mass extinction,"" said Song.,The period after the Great Dying is often portrayed as a super-hot world in which tropical life was expelled poleward, but the new findings from the Guiyang Biota hinted at cooling gaps in the tropics without lethally-hot temperatures, and these gaps supported a thriving marine system in that region, according to the study.,The study ""gives us new insights into the rate and nature of the recovery of life after this largest-of-all mass extinctions,"" said one of the paper's reviewers.,""In the foreseeable future, Guiyang Biota can definitely deliver more surprises to provide clues as to the origins of the modern marine ecosystem,"" said Song, the paper's corresponding author.,(Cover image via CFP),(,)"

"Chinese love story: Legend of the White Snake, a cross-species love story ","

            ","Snakes – from the cunning serpent in the Bible that convinces Eve to eat the fruit from the forbidden tree, to the limbless, slimy reptile covered in overlapping scales that can trigger ophidiophobia in extreme conditions – can’t be regarded as having a favorable reputation in most cases. While the species is usually labeled with tags such as dangerous, poisonous, evil and disgusting, in Chinese folklore a white-colored member of the snake family is rather famously linked to a romantic story, and is a common household tale known to many in China.,The upcoming Valentine’s Day again sheds a spotlight on this ancient legend, as the devotion, bravery and loyalty involved in this cross-species romance between a young scholar and a white snake maiden, still shimmers today.,The time-tested tale goes that a white snake spirit, longing for human life, finally managed to transform itself into a charming lady after centuries of practice and cultivation. Bearing the name of Bai Suzhen, the beautiful snake maiden fell in love with a respected doctor, Xu Xian, at first sight when they met on a rainy day on the Broken Bridge located in the picturesque West Lake of Hangzhou. ,In some other versions, the pair’s first encounter took place far earlier. It holds that when Bai Suzhen was merely a young snake, she was once saved by Xu Xian in his past life. It was driven by gratitude and the eagerness to repay such a life-saving kindness that Bai Suzhen, through her constant efforts, accomplished her transformation to take on human form. After which, she set out without hesitation to look for Xu Xian and repay him back for his generous deed. The karmic connection has given this legendary romance a sense of destiny.,And the main plotline continues. After tying the knot, the young couple set up a medicine shop, enjoying a harmonious and happy life together. But there was a looming time bomb threatening to shatter the couple’s joy, since Xu Xian had no idea of the fact that his beloved was a snake spirit. And the appearance of Fa Hai, a Buddhist monk at the Jinshan Temple, was the catalyst that lit the fuse.,Believing that such a marriage was unnatural, Fa Hai told Xu Xian that his wife was not a human being but instead an evil snake. He also convinced the doubtful husband to make Bai Suzhen drink a special wine that would prove his word. Xu Xian followed Fa Hai’s advice, tricked Bai Suzhen into drinking the wine, and witnessed his wife turning into a white snake. He then broke down and died.,Bai decided to save her husband. She braved the land of the immortals and stole a sacred magical herb from there – violating a rule that a snake spirit was never supposed to break.,Xu Xian, when brought back to life, was taken by Fa Hai to the Jinshan Temple, or Golden Hill Temple. To reclaim her husband, Bai Suzhen unleashed the waters and flooded the temple, coining a well-known Chinese idiom.,Despite the multifaceted plots and twists, there are two main endings to the Legend of White Snake. In one version, Bai Suzhen, after giving birth to her son, was punished and was imprisoned in Hangzhou’s Leifeng Pagoda on the banks of the West Lake, while her husband chose to become a monk. Compared to this tragic ending, the second version is more widely accepted, as it offers the folk tale a much happier ending. According to this version, the couple’s son, who was top scholar in the country, offered sacrifice to his mother in front of the Leifeng Pagoda, causing the pagoda to collapse and enabling the family to reunite.,More than just a love story, the Legend of White Snake deals with themes of gratitude, struggle and persistence and is counted as one of China's most famous folktales which has given rise to numerous works including folk operas, TV dramas, musical performances and animations. The legend was listed as a national intangible cultural heritage in 2006."

Overcoming obstacles in China's R&D revolution,"

    14:46, 13-Feb-2023

            ","China has marked a significant milestone for its investment in research and development (R&D). It has also presented a bold vision for China's future, with a focus on scientific and technological innovation.,In the past five years, Chinese President Xi Jinping promoted R&D for China's future growth, saying that innovation is the primary driving force for development, and we must put innovation at the center of the national development strategy. He reiterated that China must strive for technological self-reliance, stating that the country should accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into productivity. This was reflected in increased government investment in R&D, as well as efforts to increase efficiency of the country's R&D system.,Along this clarion call, China has made significant and growing investments in R&D. In 2020, the government invested $441.3 billion, which accounted for 2.4 percent of the GDP, in R&D, which saw a growth of 14.2 percent year on year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. This made China the second-largest spender on R&D in the world behind the United States. Moreover, according to the State of U.S. Science and Engineering 2022 published by the National Science Foundation, the United States at 27 percent and China at 22 percent account for almost half of global spending on R&D with Japan at 7 percent, Germany at 6 percent and South Korea at 4 percent. ,And this investment has paid off. In 2022, China moved up one place to the 11th on the World Intellectual Property Organization's Global Innovation Index. According to a report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), ""How China's Human Capital Impacts Its National Competitiveness,"" China also sourced the most peer-reviewed papers and Chinese research ranked as high as or higher than U.S. work in the top 1 percent of scientific studies in 2019.,But the challenges facing China in this area have also risen during this period and it's useful to assess whether the scale, structure and efficiency of investments in this area can propel China to ultimate success.,Despite significant increases in R&D spending, some experts argue that China's investment is not sufficient to compete in key areas of technology such as semiconductors. Also, while investment in R&D has increased, some question as to whether the current structure of investment is effective in directing towards projects with the greatest potential for impact or are being spread too thinly across a wide range of initiatives. There's also concern that R&D funding is not being used effectively, with too many resources consumed by bureaucratic inefficiencies.,But perhaps the most important issue is whether China is identifying, developing and attracting the talent necessary for achieving high levels of technological self-reliance.,This also was recognized through the articulation of a comprehensive strategy for developing human capital that begins with childhood development and primary education along with a special focus on reducing the urban-rural divide.,With regard to university education, between 2012 and 2021, China's Ministry of Education increased spending on higher education from $24 billion to $47 billion. According to the CSIS, by 2025, Chinese universities are projected to produce more than 77,000 STEM PhD graduates per year, more than double the 2010 level of about 34,000 STEM PhD graduates. In comparison, the United States is projected to graduate only approximately 40,000 STEM PhD students in 2025, a figure that includes over 16,000 international students.,So, while questions remain regarding the scale, structure and efficiency of China's investment in R&D especially in light of a more complex and challenging international environment, the progress made so far has shown tremendous success.,Looking ahead, cultivating human capital and ensuring that capabilities are fully developed and deployed will answer many of these questions. The more quickly China can develop its vast reservoir of talents and attract the best and brightest from around the world, the faster the country will realize the dream of its R&D revolution."
