"Breeders in E China' Anhui release shrimp, crab seedlings into ponds","10:01, February 09, 2023","
	Breeders have been busy releasing shrimp and crab seedlings into their outdoor ponds in Wuhe county, east China's Anhui Province.,
	,
	,
	Located in the plains of northern Anhui, Wuhe county abounds in rivers and lakes, which provide important conditions for local breeders to develop aquaculture and increase their incomes.,
	32-year-old Huang Jingzhong is a local breeder in Wuhe county. In 2018, Huang built a breeding base that uses a rice-shrimp co-culture system.,
	Last year, Huang's cultivation of crab and mandarin fish in his rice fields, which cover an area of 23 mu (about 1.53 hectares), generated more than 200,000 yuan ($29,500) in income for him.,
	,
	,
	""This year, I plan to release 100 kg of shrimp seedlings into the ponds,"" said Huang, adding that he bought the seedlings at 40 yuan per kg and will sell them at 100 yuan per kg during the harvest season.,
	Thanks to the rice-shrimp co-culture system, an increasing number of farmers in Wuhe county have enjoyed bumper harvests of both aquatic products and rice over the past years.,

Two Chinese Gen Zers turn to agriculture in E China’s Anhui,"13:28, February 09, 2023","
	Zhu Jiaojie and Li Lingfeng are two Chinese Gen Zers who make their living planting strawberries. Born after the millennium year, they have dedicated their lives to strawberry growing in Guangde city, east China’s Anhui Province.,
	“The most important part is my interest in agriculture. I studied agriculture and forestry in university. Planting strawberries fits my studies, and allows me to apply what I have learned,” says Zhu, who also acknowledges the support given by his family. As for Li, a veteran, his concern and affection for his grandparents prompted him to return home after his retirement. When he came back, he saw opportunities in rural regions and decided to forge a partnership with Zhu.,
	,
	,
	In less than two years, after learning from professionals in Guangde Sanpuhui Agriculture and Technology Development Company Co. Ltd., Zhu and Li gained a working knowledge of strawberry planting. They acquired some advanced skills here because the company is not only the strawberry plantation base of their city, it’s also the strawberry working station of Institute of Horticulture of Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.,
	When the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius, they must close the inner cover of their greenhouse. In the morning, when the temperature rises, they need to take the opportunity to ventilate them. Strawberries love sunlight and cannot survive being soaked, so they must pay special attention to make sure the strawberries have sufficient sunlight and guarantee that the excess water is drained away.,
	,
	,
	The accumulation of experience and knowledge of techniques and management, in addition to their strong work ethic, prompted them to establish their own fields. Today, in addition to owning strawberry fields, they also hold shares in Sanpuhui.,
	They have experimented with two types of planting methods: traditional planting and elevated greenhouse cultivation planting, which yield around 2,500 kilograms and 3,000 kilograms per mu (667 square meters), respectively.,
	,
	,
	In addition to the planting aspect, they have also shown a talent for innovation in sales. They use different channels to sell their produce, including livestream online sales, and self-service in-person sales. Outside their greenhouse, they have put up a stall with strawberries and a QR code for electronic payments, and customers can make purchases by themselves. This method spares them from labor costs, and increases their popularity.,
	“The picking period spans from November to April. Although sales prices have gone down, we yielded more produce this year, and we still expect to earn profits this year,” says Li.,
	The prime time for picking strawberries is around the Chinese New Year, during which Zhu and Li spent most of their time in the fields picking and processing strawberries, even on New Year’s Day and its Eve. “After finishing work in the New Year holiday, we hope to take a break from our work,” they said.,

Separated conjoined twins living healthy lives,"08:42, February 09, 2023","
	,
	,
	On April 1, 2009, doctors at Hunan Children's Hospital in Central China performed a successful surgery to separate a pair of conjoined twin girls in a procedure that took 3 hours and 13 minutes. Now, over a decade later, the girls have remained healthy and happy, living full lives.,
	The twins – Luo Hong and Luo Lan — were born in Hunan province connected from their breastbones to their abdomens and sharing one liver. This was extremely rare, as only about three in every 100,000 live births result in conjoined twins. They were separated just two weeks after birth.,
	Though the surgery went smoothly, the twins' condition was still complicated. Before being transferred to the general ward, they had been in the neonatal intensive care unit under observation by a medical team led by Gao Xirong, now director of the hospital's neonatology department.,
	More than two months later, the twins were discharged from the hospital. In subsequent years, the hospital continued to care for the twins by giving them free physical examinations every year.,
	""We have also visited their home,"" Gao said. ""Now, both girls are 1.63 meters tall, just like me. And their intellectual and physical development are normal,"" she said with relief.,
	""We are grateful to the hospital and people who have long shown their love for us,"" said Luo Guoquan, the twins' father.,
	Luo Lan, the younger sister, said she wants to be a doctor and help more people."

Bridges bring benefits to China's mountainous province,"09:18, February 12, 2023","
	,
	,
	,
	GUIYANG, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- During the past Spring Festival holiday, a large number of tourists visited the Beipanjiang Bridge, a world record holder, in southwest China's Guizhou Province.,
	Sitting over 565 meters above a valley, equivalent to the height of a 200-story building, the bridge has been certified as the world's highest bridge by the Guinness World Records.,
	Bridges are an unmistakable feature of the transportation infrastructure in Guizhou. With 92.5 percent of its area covered by mountains and hills, the province has built nearly 30,000 bridges since the late 1970s and is now home to nearly half of the 100 tallest bridges in the world.,
	Thanks to the construction of bridges, the mountainous province is becoming deeply integrated with the nation's transportation network, bringing an improved quality of life for local residents.,
	,
	,
	,
	Due to the large number of bridges, their types, and the complex technologies used in the construction of the bridges, Guizhou is known as ""the museum of world bridges,"" according to the provincial department of transport.,
	Above the grand canyon of Huajiang River, which features towering cliffs and fast-flowing currents, the mega project of a steel-truss girder suspension bridge is under construction.,
	With a vertical height of 625 meters from the bridge deck down to the water's surface, the bridge is expected to become the highest in the world after completion in 2025. It will cut the travel time across the canyon from about an hour to a mere minute.,
	Deep gorges, steep terrains, and the highly developed karst landscape left the project team with few choices but to design such a high bridge, said Wu Chaoming, the project manager of the bridge, adding that builders had to dig 68 meters beneath the ground to establish the pile foundation on one side to ensure its safety and stability.,
	,
	,
	For bridge expert, Han Hongju, who is the chief engineer of Guizhou Communications Construction Group Co., Ltd, the height of a bridge is not the only indication of sophistication in bridge building.,
	""It is far more challenging to build a bridge with a long span above deep gorges in mountainous areas,"" said Han.,
	When designing the Beipanjiang Grand Bridge, another bridge over the Beipan River, in 2013, Han came up with the innovative idea of using a beam bridge to support a major span of 290 meters.,
	The new approach defied the norm at that time when cable-stayed and suspension bridges were the first choices to deal with spans exceeding 200 meters, even though that meant a significant rise in construction costs.,
	""Bigger doesn't mean better in bridge building. Being economical is also a priority. The best bridge is the one that suits its conditions,"" said Han.,
	Under his guidance, Liuzhi Bridge on Nayong-Qinglong Expressway is under construction. With a span of 320 meters, the bridge is expected to set a new record for the span of prestressed concrete beam bridges.,
	,
	In December last year, Dafa Canal Bridge was put into operation in the Zunyi City of Guizhou after four years of construction. It has made Tuanjie Village, located in the deep mountains, more accessible.,
	""Building the bridge in a remote area is no easy task. It's a bridge that will bring happiness and prosperity to our local residents,"" said Huang Dafa, former Party chief of Tuanjian Village.,
	,
	,
	""More people are coming to the village, and business is booming,"" said Wang Chaohai, the incumbent village Party chief, adding that villagers aim to take full advantage of the convenient transport to sell high-quality rice and other agricultural products.,
	In recent years, many bridges in Guizhou have turned out to be popular tourist attractions owning to the stunning scenery around them.,
	Ma Xuanjun, a farmer living near the Beipanjiang Bridge, turned his newly-built brick house into a rural inn in 2019 and started to receive tourists from afar.,
	""Before the bridge was built, it would take us four hours to climb over the mountain to the town seat,"" said Ma, as he pointed to the gliding ropes that were used to cross the river.,
	Now, his inn is decorated with photos he took with tourists from home and abroad.,
	""Many tourists visited our village for the bridge. I will do my best to make them feel happy and remember my hometown,"" Ma said.,
	,
	,
	Xu Xianghua, the chief engineer of the Guizhou provincial department of transport, said that bridges witness the leapfrog development of transport in the mountainous province.,
	Bridges are also a unique cultural symbol of Guizhou that represent its deepening communication with the outside world, Xu added.,
	,
	For a long time, bridge builders in Guizhou had been troubled by a lack of high-quality materials for building bridges. As the rivers in the province mainly flow from alpine gorge areas, they produce little river sand, a key material for making concrete.,
	Shi Dawei, the chief engineer of Guizhou Expressway Group Co., Ltd, recalled that builders had to buy high-standard river sand from Chongqing Municipality and Hunan Province, or even from foreign countries like Malaysia.,
	To reduce the cost of materials, builders resorted to natural mountain rocks in the province, as bridge building often involved excavating mountains. After 20 years of effort, they succeeded in developing sand-making techniques by machines.,
	Since 2011, a total of more than 20 million cubic meters of machine-made sand have been used in Guizhou, saving over 7 billion yuan (about 1.03 billion U.S. dollars) in construction costs. The large-scale application of machine-made sand has also reduced river sand mining, thus contributing to environmental protection.,
	Guizhou is an important ecological barrier in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. However, it is one of the largest areas in China that suffers from stony desertification.,
	Due to the fragile ecological environment, how to minimize the impact on nature has always been a top priority for bridge builders in Guizhou. The new Huayudong Bridge, built in June 2021 to replace a decades-old one, is an exemplary case in this regard.,
	,
	,
	As the bridge is located at a scenic spot and also a protected area for a drinking water source, the designers and builders made extra efforts to reduce the environmental impact of the project.,
	Instead of building the new bridge after demolishing the old one, they used the old bridge as a construction platform and transport pathway and dismantled it step by step as the project proceeded.,
	The new approach ensured a smoother structural transition from the old bridge to the new one, thus greater construction safety, said Yang Jian, chief designer of the project.,
	Last April, the Huayudong Bridge won the Gustav Lindenthal Medal, one of the most prestigious bridge construction awards in the world.,
	The award is a recognition of the building techniques, environmental protection efforts, and aesthetic values of the Huayudong Bridge project, said Yang."

	,
	,
	BEIJING, Feb. 6 -- From February 3 to 4, local time, the Chinese 42nd and 43rd naval escort taskforces carried out a multi-subject joint training exercise in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somali.,
	At 9:00 am on February 3, the comprehensive supply ship Kekexilihu (Hull 903) of the 42nd Chinese naval escort taskforce acted as a merchant ship. Ship Huainan (Hull 123) and ship Rizhao (Hull 598) of the 42nd escort taskforce, and the ship Nanning (Hull 162), ship Sanya (Hull 574) and ship Weishanhu (Hull 887) of the 43rd escort taskforce were deployed around the simulated merchant ship and kept on high alert.,
	During the joint escort exercise, the two escort taskforces took turns to undertake command. They maintained close coordination, kept in touch with the ""merchant ship"" in real time, and conducted multiple anti-terrorism and anti-piracy drills. The guided missile destroyer Huainan also sent a ship-borne helicopter to patrol forward.,
	It is learned that the 42nd Chinese naval escort taskforce has completed escort tasks for 29 Chinese and foreign ships in 20 batches when on duty. Next, the two taskforces will hold a handover ceremony in waters of the Gulf of Aden, after which the 43rd Chinese naval escort taskforce is to independently carry out the following escort tasks."

China plays crucial role in wetland restoration,"10:07, February 09, 2023","
	,
	,
	The shrinking area of wetlands and degrading ecological functions are a challenge faced by the entire world.,
	Since becoming a party of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat, or the Ramsar Convention in 1992, China has constantly enhanced its efforts in legislation, monitoring, science popularization, and international cooperation to fulfill its obligations.,
	China's wetland conservation has gone through three stages: problem identification, rescue protection, and comprehensive conservation.,
	So far, the country has completed over 4,100 projects to advance wetland protection and restoration. It is the only country in the world that has done national wetland resource investigation three times.,
	China boasts remarkable achievements in wetland conservation. Wetland ecology is constantly improving in the country.,
	Its wetland area, covering 56.35 million hectares, ranks the first in Asia and fourth in the world. Especially in the recent decade, China has added or restored more than 800,000 hectares of wetlands. It also has 64 wetlands of international importance and 29 wetlands of national importance. The country is home to 13 international wetland cities, the highest in the world.,
	The total number of wetland-type nature reserves in China has reached more than 2,200, while 11 million hectares of wetlands are included in the country's national park system with stringent protection management.,
	,
	,
	Wetland parks well combine ecological conservation, ecological tourism, and environmental education and thus generate ecological, social, and economic benefits. They are an important part of China's wetland conservation system.,
	Chinese provinces and municipalities are constantly working to apply for national wetland parks and build regional wetland parks, demonstrating China's innovative approach to protecting, restoring, and utilizing wetland.,
	Currently, there are 29 national wetland parks and 26 provincial wetland parks in Sichuan province, and east China's Anhui province has preliminarily established a wetland conservation network that puts 51.8 percent of its wetlands under protection.,
	Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang province, is applying for the wetland city accreditation of the Ramsar Convention, and a provincial-level wetland park is expected to be built near the Qiantang River in the city. It is learned that the coverage of the wetland park will be far beyond that of the Xixi National Wetland Park in the city, which spans 11.5 square kilometers.,
	Over the past few years, China has witnessed a prominent increase in the population of wild birds in wetlands. Rare and endangered bird species have started to show up in wetlands across the country and inhabit in large groups there. This indicates improved wetland ecology in the country.,
	The Yellow River Wetland National Nature Reserve in Zhengzhou, central China's Henan province, sits in the center of the middle channel of China's three major bird migration routes. After years of treatment, the ecology in the nature reserve has constantly improved. There are currently 283 wild bird species in the reserve, up from 169 in 2006.,
	Surveys on wintering birds recently released by local authorities suggested important progress in China's ecological restoration.,
	,
	,
	According to a report by south China's Hainan province, the island province discovered 201 black-faced spoonbills this year, the most since the report started in 2003.,
	Another survey on wintering birds in the Hengshui Lake national nature reserve wetland park in north China's Hebei province said 64,000 birds and 60 species were spotted in the wetland park.,
	While implementing the Ramsar Convention and protecting wetlands, China has explored a path of ecological conservation for man and nature to live in harmony.,
	In October 2022, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration and the Ministry of Natural Resources jointly released a plan for wetland protection for the 2022-2030 period.,
	The plan aims to increase China's wetland protection rate to 55 percent by 2025. According to it, by 2030, a new paradigm of high-quality wetland conservation will be preliminarily established, and the ecological functions and biodiversity in wetlands will be prominently improved.,
	Besides, the plan will also strive to enhance the comprehensive service capability of the wetland ecology system, strengthen wetlands' carbon fixation performance, and build a better legal framework for wetland protection.,
	China will keep promoting green development and work for new progress in global wetland conservation. "

"China joins multinational naval drills in Pakistan, contributing to safeguarding sea lines, CPEC","10:46, February 12, 2023","
	,
	,
	China, together with host Pakistan and more than 50 participating countries, kicked off the AMAN-23 multinational maritime exercise in Karachi on Friday. The drills are expected to enhance the participants' interoperability against instabilities and threats in the Indian Ocean region and safeguard vital international sea lines of communication and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).,
	A grand opening ceremony for the five-day AMAN-23 exercise was held on Friday morning at the Pakistan Navy Dockyard, in front of the PNS Taimur, a Type 054A/P guided missile frigate that China built for Pakistan. Honor guards raised the participating countries' national flags, while balloons and pigeons representing peace were released into the skies.,
	Under the motto ""Together for Peace"", this is the eighth edition of the AMAN exercises since 2007. It is divided into two phases: harbor and sea.,
	The harbor phase involves seminars, operational discussions, and professional demonstrations among other preparations, and the sea phase includes tactical maneuvers, anti-piracy, counterterrorism, search and rescue, live-fire shooting as well as air defense exercises, and will be followed by an international fleet review.,
	AMAN is a message of peace and of being together with our friends and partners from all over the world, including China, Vice Admiral Ovais Ahmed Bilgrami, Commander of the Pakistan Fleet, told the Global Times on the sidelines at the opening ceremony.,
	""We want to build mutual capacities and mutual understandings so that we can all work together to ensure peace and security at sea,"" he said.,
	""China has been our greatest friend. There's no doubt that whatever the future holds for us at sea, it would not be possible without China. The China and Pakistan friendship is going to prosper further at sea,"" said Commodore Sohail Ahmed Azmie, Commander of the Auxiliary and Mine Squadron of the Pakistan Navy.,
	He told the Global Times at the event that the Pakistan Navy has been operating with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, and in the future, this trend is going to be enhanced.,
	The participating vessel from China is the Nanning, a Type 052D guided missile destroyer that is part of the PLA Navy's 43rd escort task force to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, which set out from a naval port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province on January 10.,
	It is the Nanning's first time participating in such a mission. The domestically developed warship has received an upgraded propulsion system among many other modifications, the PLA Navy said in a press release at the time.,
	The Nanning arrived at Karachi on Thursday, and was met with a warm welcome from the host country.,
	Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, Chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview prior to the exercise that there are a number of non-traditional threats that prevail in the wider Indian Ocean region such as terrorism, piracy, drug smuggling, and arms trafficking. The vastness of the oceans makes the maritime arena an attractive avenue for illegal activities, and no country has the capability to singlehandedly counter these challenges.,
	The exercise is conducted with the aim of developing synergy between participating naval units to tackle maritime security challenges by enhancing interoperability between regional and extra-regional navies at different levels of technological prowess, he said.,
	As a maritime nation, Pakistan has substantial stakes in keeping its seas safe and secure, including the operationalization of the CPEC project and the global energy highway, the Global Times learned at the exercise.,
	The first edition of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference (PIMEC) was also launched on Friday in Karachi, concurrently with the AMAM-23 exercise.,
	Initiated by the Pakistan Navy, PIMEC aims to showcase the potential of Pakistan's maritime sector and draw attention to the contribution that the maritime industry can make to the development of the blue economy. "
