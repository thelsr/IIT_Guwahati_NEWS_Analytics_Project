"To resume all-round dialogue with China, U.S. should take sincere actions: defense spokesperson","08:29, December 30, 2022","
	,
	,
	BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- If the United States wants to conduct positive and constructive dialogue and exchanges with China, it must show sincerity with practical deeds, said a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense on Thursday.,
	The United States should earnestly respect China's core interests and major concerns, and actively create conditions and atmosphere for bringing bilateral military relations back to the right track, said spokesperson Tan Kefei while answering a media inquiry at a press conference.,
	The spokesperson said that China's cancellation of three exchanges between the two militaries was a necessary countermeasure against the United States, who wantonly created a major crisis and severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ""The cause and effect are clear, and the U.S. side knows that,"" he added.,
	The United States has issued multiple negative policy documents and bills concerning China in succession recently, made an uproar about major-country competition, hyped the so-called ""China threat,"" and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs. It further damaged the basis and atmosphere for communication and exchanges between the two militaries, said Tan.,
	""China attaches great importance to the development of China-U.S. military relations, and the communication between the two militaries at the working level has never been interrupted,"" said the spokesperson.,
	""However, the U.S. side cannot seek to resume dialogue and exchanges with China in an all-round manner while, at the same time, constantly damaging China's interests, let alone confusing the whole story and blaming China for the cancellation of some military exchanges,"" Tan said."

	BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- China will optimize immigration administration policies and measures starting from Jan. 8, 2023 in compliance with the country's downgraded COVID-19 response measures.,
	The National Immigration Administration issued a notice on Tuesday, saying that the optimized policies and measures include the resumption of accepting and approval of Chinese citizens' applications for ordinary passports for the purposes of tourism and visiting friends abroad starting from the date.,

Experts decode China's shift in COVID response policies,"08:13, December 28, 2022","
	BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's National Health Commission (NHC) announced on Monday that the country will downgrade its level of COVID-19 management from the current Class A to a less strict Class B starting from Jan. 8, 2023.,
	Health experts have shed light on this major shift in China's COVID-19 response policies. China has classified COVID-19 as a Class B infectious disease, but opted to manage it under Class A response protocols since Jan. 20, 2020.,
	,
	Liang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 response expert panel under the NHC, said China now has the necessary conditions for this policy shift, which include waning virulence of the Omicron variant, mass vaccination of the population, improving capabilities of medical treatment, secured manufacturing and supply of medicines designed to fight the virus, enhanced public health awareness, and growing capabilities for personal protection.,
	When an infectious disease emerges, we lack knowledge of its pathogenic and epidemiologic features, and there isn't a clear picture of how contagious and virulent it is, and how the virus is going to mutate. A wise response is to classify the emerging infectious disease as a Class B infectious disease but manage it under Class A protocols to protect people's lives to the greatest extent possible, Liang noted.,
	However, when the impact of the infectious disease on people's health, the economy and society wanes, it is necessary to adjust response measures in a dynamic manner in line with laws and regulations, Liang said, citing China's experience in dealing with SARS in 2003, bird flu in 2005 and H1N1 flu in 2009.,
	As an immediate result of the policy adjustment, a surge in COVID-19 infections is likely, which has the potential to lead to shortages of medicine and public panic, Liang said. ""Response plans have been put in place to ensure a smooth transition,"" he added.,
	""The current focus of the response has been shifted from infection prevention to medical treatment,"" Liang said, adding that the utmost efforts will be made to prevent severe cases and fatalities.,
	,
	The downgrade in COVID-19 management level will be followed by a series of easing measures, according to Lei Zhenglong, an official from the NHC.,
	These include a longer time limit for case reporting, lifting quarantine measures against people infected with the virus and their close contacts, as well as venues with infections, and canceling health and quarantine inspections for travel, said Lei.,
	The content and the frequency of data revealing will also be adjusted, according to Li Qun, an official with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Li said information of close contacts will no longer be disclosed.,
	According to Li, the trend of the epidemic and key populations, instead of each case, will be the focus of COVID-19 monitoring in the coming period. The official also noted that coronavirus variants will be closely monitored and the results of this monitoring will be published on the China CDC website.,
	Having been proved effective in coping with various infectious diseases in China over the past years, society-wide joint prevention and control efforts will continue to play an important role in the country's adjustments in COVID-19 management in the future, Li noted.,
	,
	Noting the recent rapid increase in the need for fever clinics, Jiao Yahui, head of the Bureau of Medical Administration under the NHC, said generally speaking, the growth rate is relatively stable, and that the utilization rate of medical resources is within a safe and controllable range.,
	To cope with changes under the new epidemic management strategy, the NHC has issued a series of guidelines to prepare the country's health care system, including increasing the supply of medical services, promoting a tiered diagnosis and treatment system, and expanding internet-based medical services, said Jiao.,
	By Dec. 15, more than 15,000 fever clinics had been set up in grade II hospitals and above, while more than 35,000 fever clinics or consulting rooms were available in primary-level medical and health institutions.,
	The NHC has set up a daily reviewing system as the basis for overall decisions concerning the preparation and use of medical resources across the country.,
	Guo Yanhong, director of the NHC Health Emergency Response Office, said the NHC required medical institutions at or above the county level to dynamically keep a drug reserve sufficient for three months.,
	Guo added that primary-level medical and health institutions should prepare enough relevant drugs for 15 to 20 percent of their service population, while a higher reserve may be prepared for those in densely populated areas."
"Chinese premier stresses timely, full wage payment for migrant workers","08:27, December 30, 2022","
	BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday urged efforts to ensure timely and full payment of salaries to rural migrant workers and the strengthening of employment support for the group.,
	Li made the remarks while instructing a work conference of the leading group of the State Council on eradicating wage arrears for migrant workers from rural areas.,
	Efforts should be made to strengthen joint law enforcement of multiple authorities and investigations in those fields where wage arrears are prone to occur more frequently.,
	The country will severely punish malicious violations related to wage payment according to law, and will implement the policy of withholding deposits from employers, to ensure timely and full wage payments to rural migrant workers, Li said.,
	Stressing the work to step up assistance to rural migrant workers, Li said the country should offer unemployment compensation and assistance in time to those who have lost their jobs or are in difficulties to secure the basic livelihoods of the people.,
	Chinese Vice Premier Hu Chunhua, also head of the leading group, attended the meeting and called for solid efforts in safeguarding the lawful rights and interests of migrant workers from rural areas.,
	Hu urged efforts to strengthen the protection of migrant rural workers with difficulties, assist them through multiple channels and stabilize employment of the group."
China to manage COVID-19 with measures against Class B infectious diseases,"09:04, December 27, 2022","
	,
	,
	BEIJING - China will manage COVID-19 with measures against Class B infectious diseases, instead of Class A infectious diseases, in a major shift of its epidemic response policies.,
	China has renamed the Chinese term for COVID-19 from ""novel coronavirus pneumonia"" to ""novel coronavirus infection,"" said a statement released by the National Health Commission on Monday.,
	Starting from Jan. 8, China will downgrade management of the disease from Class A to Class B in accordance with the country's law on prevention and treatment of infectious disease, and remove it from quarantinable infectious disease management carried out in accordance with the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of the People's Republic of China, added the statement.,
	Currently, COVID-19 is classified as a Class B infectious disease but subject to the preventive and control measures for a Class A infectious disease in China.,
	Basic conditions have been in place to support such an adjustment, said a document released by the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism against COVID-19 on the same day, citing the latest virus mutation, the development of the epidemic and the country's epidemic response basis.,
	Authorities will drop quarantine measures against people infected with novel coronavirus and stop identifying close contacts or designating high-risk and low-risk areas, said the document.,
	COVID-19 cases will receive classified treatment and a timely adjustment will be made to medical care policies. The country will also adjust its testing policies as well as the frequency and content of epidemic information release.,
	In addition, disease control measures targeting inbound travelers and imported cargo will be lifted, said the document.,
	Following the adjustment, China's COVID-19 prevention and control efforts will focus on protecting health and preventing severe cases. Measures will be rolled out to protect people's lives and health to the utmost and minimize the impact of the epidemic on economic and social development."
China to downgrade COVID-19 management to Class B,"11:26, December 28, 2022","
	China will downgrade management of COVID-19 to Class B and cancel quarantine requirements on inbound travelers from Jan. 8, 2023, China's top health authority announced recently.,
	In a statement released late Monday, the National Health Commission (NHC) renamed the Chinese term for COVID-19 from ""novel coronavirus pneumonia"" to ""novel coronavirus infection,"" and will manage the disease from Class A to Class B in accordance with the Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Disease.,
	Additionally, it said that COVID-19 will no longer be included in the quarantinable infectious disease management following the Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of the People's Republic of China.,
	,
	,
	The new term better accurately describes the current disease characteristics as the Omicron variant becomes the global dominant strain, which includes declining pathogenicity and only a few cases showing pneumonia-like symptoms, said a document released by the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism against COVID-19 on the same day.,
	The decision was made after China's COVID-19 control reached a new stage as the virulence of the virus dropped, the document added. Considering its vaccination rate, medical resources and experience in prevention and control, China has the right conditions for downgrading the management.,
	According to the document, the country will no longer implement quarantine measures for infected individuals, and stop tracking close contacts or designating high-risk and low-risk areas. It will provide classified treatment for COVID-19 cases and promptly modify medical care policies.,
	,
	,
	The document further clarifies that starting from Jan. 8, China won't conduct any quarantinable infectious disease control measures for inbound persons and imported goods. Passengers entering the country still have to take nucleic acid tests 48 hours before departure.,
	The country will gradually resume passenger entry and exit at sea and land ports, as well as outbound tourism in an orderly manner. Arrangements for foreigners to visit China for work, business or other purposes will be improved and the required visas will also be facilitated, the document added.,
	Following the adjustment, China will keep track of the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen the health monitoring of special groups such as the elderly. Appropriate steps will also be implemented to ensure adequate medical resources and lessen the impact on economic and social development, said the authorities.,

Result matters -- foreigners share views on China's COVID-19 fight,"08:28, December 26, 2022","
	,
	,
	,
	BEIJING, Dec. 25 (Xinhua) -- For the past three years, Mauro De Felip, general manager of Ferrero China, has been spending most of his time in China, particularly in Shanghai.,
	""I think that China has been particularly successful in managing the pandemic since the very beginning of 2020, without compromising the health of its people, which is the top priority of the government of course,"" De Felip said.,
	After experiencing the country's hard but extraordinary fight against the virus over the past three years, many foreigners working or studying in China have offered their insights into China's evolving COVID-19 response strategy.,
	,
	De Felip remembers in particular the first year of the epidemic. ""I think they made the right move at that moment. And the results are there to also justify this in terms of the containment of the virus and the protection of the Chinese people at the end."",
	Facing the COVID-19 in early 2020, China adopted swift, resolute and great efforts to contain the virus and achieved a decisive victory in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city Wuhan in about three months.,
	Data shows that China logged the lowest COVID-19 incidence rate and death toll among all major countries in the world during the period.,
	The principle and practice of putting the people and their lives first, which China has been upholding in the fight against the virus, also impressed Yulia Temelidi, a Russian student at Tsinghua University.,
	""No matter you're a foreigner or you're a citizen of China, it always puts you as a person first,"" said Temelidi, a junior majoring in economy.,
	,
	,
	""I think the overall COVID policy was consistent and well carried out. I felt safe all the time, and the vaccines were provided to us all in a timely manner,"" said Maria Sofia Molina Bulla, an Argentinian who teaches Spanish at Tongling University in east China's Anhui Province.,
	Josef Gregory Mahoney, a professor of politics and international relations at East China Normal University, returned to China in December 2021 from the United States. He praised what he had seen in China as ""an unprecedented public health achievement."",
	""In fact, China has innovated control methods, improved them, and demonstrated their efficacy by saving millions of lives. They have succeeded and are still succeeding. The science has been improved and so have the controls,"" said Mahoney.,
	,
	,
	Ramón Sariego-Villar, managing director for Electrolux China and Northeast Asia, has been in Shanghai since 2019. In his opinion, China has kept things under control over the past few years, not only from the standpoint of COVID-19 prevention, but also from an economic perspective.,
	""In 2020 and 2021, we had fantastic results. We have record high sales and even a very good profitability. And this year still, we are on track. So very good results I would say,"" Sariego-Villar said.,
	Mahoney said some international critics of China's COVID-19 policy underestimate the global public health value of the controls, which, aside from protecting the roughly 20 percent of the world's population that lives in China itself, has also suppressed countless new mutations and new economic disruptions that would have further imperiled global supply chains.,
	,
	In the view of Molina Bulla, these past three years have bought China enough time to deal with the virus. ""The health sector is in much better condition, both theoretically and practically, and the virus is not as deadly as before,"" she said. ""And also, it had enough time to make sure the population gets vaccinated."",
	Mahoney has also seen China's efforts over the past several months to make epidemic controls less onerous and more efficient.,
	""What we are seeing is an orderly, gradualist transition that accounts for China's unique demographic challenges. We can seek a different path, which I think is what we are trying to do in China presently, feeling the stones by crossing the river,"" he said, adding that this includes new policies that aim to ensure livelihoods while fighting COVID-19 resurgences, which are being implemented.,
	,
	,
	However, the professor noted, some countries look at China through a perverse lens: they fail to acknowledge the country's successes, because they politicize everything about China ideologically.,
	De Felip held a similar view. He said the new measures that China has taken in optimizing COVID-19 response will allow the country to adapt better to the new variant of the virus. ""I really think that will also allow the country to go into a new phase of the management of the virus and a new normal step by step."",
	The interviewed foreigners are optimistic about China's recovery in normal life and work, believing it will have a positive impact on the economy overall.,
	""Step by step, we need to rebuild the consumer confidence. And when the consumer confidence comes back, the consumer demand will come back as well,"" Sariego-Villar said.,
	,
	,
	He said his company was able to move to a new office in Hongkou District, Shanghai, with the support of the local government, indicating the local government's interest in attracting foreign investment and driving business.,
	""We have been able to prevent the epidemic and continue developing the economy well at the same time,"" Sariego-Villar said.,
	Molina Bulla said China's COVID-19 policies and experience in this regard would enable the country to be well-guarded for any other viruses that might come in the future. ""People know now what to do, how to organize themselves, and not to panic, and the government has proved that it can take care of its people no matter what,"" she said."

Type 055 large destroyer leads PLA warships in island chain-breaking voyage,"16:58, December 16, 2022","
	,
	,
	Led by a 10,000 ton-class large destroyer, a group of warships of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy reportedly sailed beyond the first island chain on Wednesday via two strategically important straits near Japan, a routine exercise experts said on Thursday sent a signal amid Japan’s recent militaristic moves, including updates to its national security strategies with the plan to increase military spending and referring to China as a ""strategic challenge."",
	Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force spotted a PLA Navy flotilla consisting of the Type 055 large destroyer Lhasa, the Type 052D destroyer Kaifeng and the Type 903A replenishment ship Taihu sailing from the East China Sea through the Osumi Strait into the West Pacific from Tuesday to Wednesday and a PLA Navy electronic reconnaissance vessel with hull number 796 sailing from the East China Sea through the Miyako Strait into the West Pacific from Monday to Wednesday, Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff said in two press releases on Wednesday.,
	This is the second time the Lhasa has made a voyage into distant waters this year, with the first one in June, when it led a flotilla of a similar configuration into the Sea of Japan, and then sailed in a circle around Japan before returning, according to releases by Japan's Ministry of Defense Joint Staff at the time.,
	The latest voyage is likely a regular far sea training exercise carried out according to training schedules, which is aimed at enhancing the Lhasa and other vessels’ operational capabilities in far sea, a Beijing-based military expert told the Global Times on Thursday, requesting anonymity.,
	It also comes at a time when Japan recently updated its national security strategies, which plan to increase the country’s military spending and referred to China as a ""strategic challenge."",
	Japan is also planning to purchase Tomahawk cruise missiles from the US, which experts believe are of a type of aggressive, standoff weapon that can be used in first attacks, going against Japan’s pacifist constitution set after Japan’s defeat in World War II.,
	It also came after a senior official of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party recently also visited the island of Taiwan and made irresponsible remarks on China.,
	While the PLA warships’ far sea training is routine and not aimed at any third party, it will display the PLA’s capabilities in safeguarding China’s national sovereignty, territorial integrity and development interests, as well as defending the post-World War II international order, the expert said."

	Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks at a regular press conference in response to media reports on Japan's recent revisions in several security documents that defined China as the greatest-ever strategic challenge to Japan and included content related to Japan's military build-up and the Taiwan question.,
	The China-related contents of the documents distort facts and are fraught with prejudice, promoting the so-called China threat, Tan said, adding that the contents slander the development of China's national defense and armed forces, as well as their normal military activities, grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and provoked tensions in the region.,
	Tan voiced firm opposition to such content.,
	Facts have proved that China is a partner to other countries and offers them development opportunities, and that the Chinese armed forces are a staunch force safeguarding world peace and have never challenged or threatened anyone, Tan said.,
	Japan, on the contrary, has been significantly increasing its defense spending and stepping up the development of military technologies in response to the so-called external threat, Tan said.,
	Tan also rebuked Japan for its enhanced military cooperation with the United States, saying that Japan has become an actual ""challenge"" to regional peace, security and stability.,
	Regarding the Taiwan question, Tan stressed that Taiwan belongs to China and the Taiwan question is a matter that falls under China's internal affairs, in which Japan is in no position to interfere.,
	Noting that the year 2023 will mark the 45th anniversary of the signature of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Tan urged Japan to scrap its beggar-thy-neighbor practices and stop treating neighbors as enemies.,
	Japan should devote more efforts to safeguarding peace and stability in the region, Tan said."
