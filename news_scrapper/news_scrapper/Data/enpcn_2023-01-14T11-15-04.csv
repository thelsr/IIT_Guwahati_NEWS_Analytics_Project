China's catering industry in steady recovery thanks to optimization of COVID-19 response,"11:21, January 07, 2023","
	,
	,
	China's optimization of COVID-19 response measures is leading to a rebound in the catering industry.,
	Restaurants across the country have resumed dine-in services and are preparing for a peak period that may arrive with the upcoming Chinese New Year, which will fall on Jan. 22.,
	Sanlitun, a popular shopping area favored by young people in Beijing's Chaoyang district, is currently seeing a recovery in foot traffic, and that includes a restaurant of Haidilao, a leading hot pot restaurant chain in China, at Sanlitun SOHO, a shopping-residence-business complex.,
	""Today we will probably serve over 200 tables, and dozens of tables have already been booked at noon. Reservations just get frequent as the Chinese New Year approaches, which will keep us busier,"" said Xu Bin, manager of the hot pot restaurant.,
	Over the past year, the restaurant's business performance went through ups and downs. Fortunately, it is getting better these days.,
	The restaurant resumed operation on Dec. 7 last year after a short suspension of dine-in services. Its business remained gloomy in the first few days, but has turned better since Dec. 16.,
	Xu told People's Daily that the number of diners at night recently was sometimes as many as that before the breakout of COVID-19, which boosted the turnover of the restaurant.,
	""The foot traffic in other periods of time is also recovering, and it would increase 30 percent on weekends,"" Xu said.,
	According to Chinese internet giant Meituan, the dining industry has recovered across the country to different extents since Dec. 8, 2022, and foot traffic has kept growing.,
	For instance, the number of online reservations for dine-in services received by restaurants in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong province since December has more than doubled from that in the previous stage.,
	,
	,
	Urumqi, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, has seen a 413 percent weekly growth since Dec. 8 in the number of online reservations for dine-in services.,
	At noon on Dec. 18, 2022, couriers were seen entering and exiting a mini hot pot restaurant in Chengdu, southwest China's Sichuan province. Jiang Sanchun, owner of the restaurant, said over 150 delivery orders had flooded in.,
	This restaurant, which covers only some 60 square meters, is located in an alley of Chengdu's Jinjiang district. Its dine-in and delivery services are both recovering thanks to the optimized COVID-19 response measures recently announced by China.,
	""We serve 80 to 100 tables of dine-in customers per day, and delivery orders are growing fast that we receive more than 300 of them on a daily basis,"" Jiang said.,
	Jiang estimated that the business would recover faster, saying his restaurant was fully prepared.,
	His restaurant sits near to a business district, but its foot traffic was not stable in recent years. Therefore, the restaurant joined an online delivery platform to expand its service range and improve its digital operation. Now, over 60 percent of the restaurant's revenue comes from delivery service.,
	Many catering enterprises made innovations amid COVID-19, expanding their online sales channels and integrating online and offline services so as to recover their business.,
	""Through technological innovation and information sharing, delivery platforms are able to help catering enterprises enhance their capability in digitalization and improve their efficiency in digital operation,"" said an employee of Meituan.,
	,
	,
	According to the employee, Meituan has launched a special service that invites professionals in the food delivery sector to offer training and guidance for inexperienced small- and medium-sized restaurants.,
	As of mid-November last year, over 70,000 small- and medium-sized restaurants in China had gotten the service for free, and their monthly revenue had increased by nearly 30 percent each.,
	To help catering enterprises tide over difficulties, a series of policies were issued in China. In early 2022, the National Development and Reform Commission and other departments unveiled measures to guide online food delivery platforms to lower service charge and assist catering enterprises with insurance and loan renewal. In May, the State Council launched a package of policies that would give stronger support to catering and other sectors under pressure. In June, the Ministry of Commerce, together with other 10 departments, issued a notice requesting efforts to recover the catering industry in six aspects.,
	""Though we are still going to face challenges in the new year, the catering industry will accelerate its steps toward recovery with the optimization of COVID-19 response measures,"" said Yang Liu, secretary-general of the China Cuisine Association. "
"China updates COVID-19 diagnosis, treatment protocol","09:05, January 07, 2023","
	BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- China released its 10th edition of the diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 on Friday.,
	The new protocol, jointly issued by the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, changed the Chinese term for COVID-19 from ""novel coronavirus pneumonia"" to ""novel coronavirus infection."",
	The protocol no longer requires the identification of suspected cases, optimizes clinical classification, improves treatment methods, and adjusts hospital discharge standards.,
	According to the protocol, those infected with the virus can stay at home or seek medical attention at medical institutions. The quarantine of positive cases at designated venues no longer applies in the new protocol.,
	The protocol optimizes treatment methods targeting the currently prevalent COVID-19 variants. COVID-19 drugs approved by Chinese authorities for marketing are included in the new protocol. It emphasizes the philosophy of jointly treating COVID-19 infection and underlying health conditions, as well as improves content concerning the use of traditional Chinese medicine in treating the disease.,
	The protocol does not require a nucleic acid test result when a patient recovers and leaves the hospital. "
"China spares no efforts in ensuring anti-COVID drug development, supply","08:18, January 10, 2023","
	,
	,
	,
	BEIJING, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- China is implementing swift and concrete measures to accelerate drug development, production and supply in order to guarantee better treatment of COVID-19 cases, as the country adjusts its epidemic response policy.,
	Weakened pathogenicity of the virus, a high vaccination rate and the accumulation of experience in prevention and control, have allowed China to optimize its COVID-19 response this winter.,
	The current focus of China's epidemic response has shifted from preventing infections to beefing up treatment of severe cases, which has greatly increased demand for relevant drugs, both from self-quarantined patients at home and from severe cases in hospital.,
	,
	,
	,
	Chinese drug researchers and developers have been racing against the clock to find the right medicine to beat the virus in two ways: biological macromolecular drugs based on antibodies and small molecular compounds that can inhibit virus invasion and replication.,
	A China-developed oral antiviral agent called VV116, which is a potent anti-COVID-19 drug, has been proven as effective as Pfizer's Paxlovid in increasing the speed of clinical recovery, and it has shown improved performance during the early onset of Omicron infections, according to a study recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.,
	China has kept broadening its range of options. Its drug regulator has granted conditional approval for the import of the Paxlovid COVID-19 pill.,
	It has also activated special approval procedures and granted conditional approval for the import registration of Merck's COVID-19 treatment Molnupiravir -- for adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and a high risk of progressing to severe cases.,
	The small-molecule oral drug can be given to patients who, for instance, are elderly, overweight, or have chronic renal diseases, diabetes, severe cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases.,
	Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has also been widely applied and has shown unique benefits in the treatment of COVID-19 infections.,
	For those with severe symptoms, integrated treatment with Chinese and Western medicine can effectively prevent the disease from becoming more severe or at least slow the development of more severe symptoms, thus reducing the fatality rate, said Huang Luqi, deputy head of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, at a recent national media conference.,
	,
	,
	,
	Targeting classic symptoms of the infection, China has improved its production capacity for fever and pain relievers ibuprofen and paracetamol.,
	The country's daily production capacity of ibuprofen and paracetamol has exceeded 200 million tablets, while the daily output reached 190 million. In addition, the maximum daily output of children's antipyretic medicine has reached 1.12 million bottles.,
	There are 194 types of antipyretic, antitussive, antibacterial and antiviral drugs on the Chinese market.,
	Enterprises have increased drug development and distribution efforts. Jilin Natu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has developed and manufactured new products which assist in enhancing patients' resistance, clearing fever, detoxifying, and reducing inflammation.,
	A pharmaceutical company in Zibo city, east China's Shandong Province, has increased its production capacity by more than 60 percent. All its production lines and employees are required to give priority to the production of COVID-19 treatment drugs.,
	Medical enterprises in the northwestern Gansu Province's Minxian County, home to TCM herbs, are working hard to produce key medicines, such as cough medicines. At present, the daily output of key medicines for COVID-19 control in this region totals 150,000 boxes and TCM preparations reach 200,000 bags.,
	,
	,
	,
	China is paying special attention to drug distribution and emergency reserves for elderly people and for people in rural and remote areas, as it optimizes its COVID-19 response.,
	Village doctors play an important role in this regard. Yang Pengcheng, a rural doctor in Baoding, north China's Hebei Province, has been on a tight schedule lately, delivering medicine to 50 or 60 households with COVID-19 patients daily.,
	Yang begins by decocting TCM according to the formula recommended by the county's health bureau and based on each patient's condition. After that, the veteran doctor embarks on a long trip, delivering boiled TCM remedies to the patients from house to house.,
	He also carries his usual medical bag with antipyretic medicine, and his sphygmomanometer, pulse oximeter, thermometer and stethoscope, to check the patients' health conditions.,
	""Not so long ago, my whole family contracted COVID-19. So I called our village doctors, and they brought us TCM decoctions and other Western medicine,"" said Yang Shaokun, a villager.,
	In Baoding, there are more than 7,700 rural doctors like Yang Pengcheng. In Zhujiayu Village alone, 12 rural doctors protect the health of more than 6,500 villagers, including over 600 elderly aged 65 and above, many of whom have difficulty walking.,
	,
	,
	Grassroots units of the government and other social forces are also mobilized to deliver medicines and help patients in need.,
	In Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province, government and community workers delivered care packages containing ibuprofen and other medical supplies to vulnerable groups such as seniors living alone.,
	Online distribution of medical supplies via e-commerce platforms has been launched in 11 provincial-level regions, benefiting over 2 million patients -- most of whom are in remote rural areas.,
	The country has also strengthened cross-region transfers of medical supplies. By Dec. 28, 2022, over 174 million ibuprofen tablets and 60 million paracetamol tablets had been allocated to key areas across the country."
Wild giant panda rescued after entering villager's courtyard in China's Sichuan,"10:17, January 07, 2023","
	,
	,
	CHENGDU, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- A wild giant panda in Lushan County in Ya'an City, southwest China's Sichuan Province, has been rescued through the joint efforts of local villagers, forestry authorities, police and experts, after it was found in a villager's courtyard.,
	On Thursday morning, local police received a report that a giant panda had been found in a villager's courtyard in Xiaohe Village, Dachuan Township. The wild animal did not look well when discovered, laying there motionless, and it was seemingly lethargic and had a poor appetite for the meat and apples it was offered, according to witnesses.,
	Local police and forestry officials rushed to the site after receiving the report of the giant panda. Though no visible signs of trauma were found, local forestry workers speculated that it was likely unwell or searching for food and water, leading it to travel down the hill and into the village.,
	At approximately 4 p.m. Thursday, experts from the Bifengxia panda base in Ya'an, under the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda, took the wild panda to the center's veterinary hospital for further observation and care.,
	The animal was later confirmed to be an adult male weighing approximately 58 kilograms. Experts gave the panda preliminary first-aid measures and further physical examination and medical treatment are underway.,
	Dachuan Township is part of the Lushan section of the giant panda national park, and several villagers have recently reported traces of wild giant pandas.,
	This is the third time that wild pandas were reported to have visited local villages since December 2022."
China's promotion of harmonious co-existence between man and nature wins worldwide acclaim,"10:22, January 07, 2023","
	BEIJING, Jan. 6 (Xinhua) -- The year 2022 witnessed a series of disasters: In Europe, historic heatwaves had set the tone for this summer, causing some 15,000 deaths; in West Africa, disastrous floods displaced nearly 1.5 million people; and in Southeast Asia and parts of America, a La Nina event caused increased occurrence of climate chaos.,
	""Humanity has a choice: cooperate or perish,"" warned UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres at the Sharm El-Sheikh Climate Implementation Summit in November.,
	A succession of international conferences on themes covering wetlands conservation, fighting climate change and biodiversity protection were held over the past months as global concerns on ecological environment kept on rising.,
	China has been committed to advancing ecological progress, planning its development in the context of promoting harmony between man and nature. As Chinese President Xi Jinping has put it, ""we must work together to promote harmonious co-existence between man and Nature, build a community of all life on the Earth, and create a clean and beautiful world for us all."" China's achievements in ecological conservation and enhancing biodiversity protection are gaining more recognition and acclaim from around the world.,
	,
	With melting glaciers, rising sea levels and more frequent occurrence of climate-related disasters, the Earth has sounded its alarm. Reducing carbon emissions is a pressing task for all nations.,
	China, the world's largest developing country, has made strenuous efforts to reduce carbon emissions and tackle climate change. A green transformation is taking place here.,
	From 2012 to 2021, China's carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP declined by 34.4 percent, and energy consumption per unit of GDP decreased by 26.4 percent, equivalent to saving of 1.4 billion tons of standard coal.,
	The country has pledged to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, marking the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity in the shortest time frame in history.,
	China has been vigorously promoting energy transformation with installed capacities of hydropower, wind power and solar power generation ranking first in the world. It has become a major producer and buyer of new energy vehicles and established the world's largest carbon market.,
	According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China has become the world's largest contributor to the growth of renewable energy capacity.,
	The country is ""expected to account for almost half of new global renewable power capacity additions over the 2022-2027 period,"" said the IEA in its 2022 annual report.,
	As progress is being made domestically, China also promotes international cooperation in exploiting renewable energy resources, and pushes forward multilateral collaboration on cutting carbon emissions.,
	Around 35 km away from Abu Dhabi, the Al Dhafra Solar Project is expected to generate 2 gigawatts of clean electricity for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This UAE-China cooperative project will help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2.4 million tons per year and play an important role in the sustainable development of the UAE's economy.,
	China's strenuous effort in developing renewable energy to replace fossil fuels has been a ""story of hope"" in fighting climate change, said Kevin Conrad, executive director of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations.,
	""China for us is a good example of the types of investment that need to be made. China is showing the world hope,"" he said.,
	,
	Earth is the home shared by us all. It is a sad and worrisome discovery that monitored wildlife populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish across the globe have seen a devastating 69 percent decline on average since 1970.,
	There is no time to lose in securing a nature-positive society, the World Wildlife Fund warned in the 14th edition of its biennial Living Planet Report 2022.,
	""A sound ecosystem is essential for the prosperity of civilization. We must work together to promote harmonious co-existence between man and Nature, build a community of all life on the Earth, and create a clean and beautiful world for us all,"" Xi said on Dec. 15 when addressing via videolink the opening ceremony of the high-level segment of the second part of the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) held in Montreal, Canada.,
	China, a country with some of the richest biological resources in the world, attaches great importance to ecological conservation. Steadfast efforts have been made to preserve the ecological system and protect biodiversity.,
	Starting in 2015, the country has launched 10 pilot national parks, including parks dedicated to the protection of Siberian tigers and Amur leopards, as well as giant pandas.,
	Currently, the at-risk status of wild giant pandas in China has been downgraded from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable,"" as their population has grown to some 1,800, and the endangered ""smiling angel"" Yangtze finless porpoise has been seen in the Yangtze River.,
	A total of 90 percent of China's terrestrial ecosystem types and 74 percent of key state-protected wild flora and fauna species have been placed under effective protection measures, and the wild populations of over 300 rare and endangered flora and fauna species have been restored and increased.,
	China holds the presidency of COP15. It held the phase-one meeting in Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province in 2021. It chaired the second phase of COP15 in Montreal. Under China's presidency, COP15 has adopted the global biodiversity framework ahead of schedule.,
	In holding the COP15 presidency, China has shown leadership in global biodiversity protection, Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, has said.,
	""China has been phenomenal,"" Andersen said. ""I will thank China for its leadership. I think that has been something quite remarkable in complex times. And we have seen China being very steadfast in this regard."",
	,
	According to World Population Prospects 2022, the global population reaches 8 billion this year. It is an important milestone in human development, and also a test on the stressed ecosystem of the Earth.,
	The behavior of all human beings and choice of development paths by all nations will determine whether a healthy and sustainable ecological system can be maintained on planet Earth.,
	With a population of more than 1.4 billion, China is striving to build a modern socialist country in all respects through a Chinese path. The Chinese way values ecological civilization and puts ecological conservation high on the agenda.,
	The philosophy of harmonious co-existence between man and nature, together with China's efforts to follow it through in collaboration with nations around the globe, has won worldwide acclaim.,
	Bruno Oberle, director general of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), lauded China for spearheading the concept of ecological civilization.,
	""Indeed, environmental protection, social progress and economic development are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing,"" Oberle said, noting that the concept of ecological civilization is also consistent with the IUCN's vision of a just world that values and conserves nature.,
	""China is sharing this concept with the rest of the world. It's a contribution that China has already been doing for a long time,"" he said.,
	Sommad Pholsena, vice president of the Lao National Assembly, commended China for putting harmony between humankind and nature in development planning, saying it assures the world that China seeks a high-quality and green development.,
	""Ecological civilization is a key element of the current five-year plan (of China), and I think that's good. We in Norway and many other countries are thinking in the same direction,"" said Norway's Climate and Environment Minister Espen Barth Eide."
"To resume all-round dialogue with China, U.S. should take sincere actions: defense spokesperson","08:29, December 30, 2022","
	,
	,
	BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- If the United States wants to conduct positive and constructive dialogue and exchanges with China, it must show sincerity with practical deeds, said a spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense on Thursday.,
	The United States should earnestly respect China's core interests and major concerns, and actively create conditions and atmosphere for bringing bilateral military relations back to the right track, said spokesperson Tan Kefei while answering a media inquiry at a press conference.,
	The spokesperson said that China's cancellation of three exchanges between the two militaries was a necessary countermeasure against the United States, who wantonly created a major crisis and severely undermined China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. ""The cause and effect are clear, and the U.S. side knows that,"" he added.,
	The United States has issued multiple negative policy documents and bills concerning China in succession recently, made an uproar about major-country competition, hyped the so-called ""China threat,"" and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs. It further damaged the basis and atmosphere for communication and exchanges between the two militaries, said Tan.,
	""China attaches great importance to the development of China-U.S. military relations, and the communication between the two militaries at the working level has never been interrupted,"" said the spokesperson.,
	""However, the U.S. side cannot seek to resume dialogue and exchanges with China in an all-round manner while, at the same time, constantly damaging China's interests, let alone confusing the whole story and blaming China for the cancellation of some military exchanges,"" Tan said."

China's defense spokesperson urges Japan to scrap beggar-thy-neighbor practices,"10:13, December 30, 2022","
	,
	,
	BEIJING, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese defense spokesperson on Thursday urged Japan to drop its beggar-thy-neighbor practices and stop treating neighbors as enemies.,
	Tan Kefei, spokesperson for China's Ministry of National Defense, made the remarks at a regular press conference in response to media reports on Japan's recent revisions in several security documents that defined China as the greatest-ever strategic challenge to Japan and included content related to Japan's military build-up and the Taiwan question.,
	The China-related contents of the documents distort facts and are fraught with prejudice, promoting the so-called China threat, Tan said, adding that the contents slander the development of China's national defense and armed forces, as well as their normal military activities, grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and provoked tensions in the region.,
	Tan voiced firm opposition to such content.,
	Facts have proved that China is a partner to other countries and offers them development opportunities, and that the Chinese armed forces are a staunch force safeguarding world peace and have never challenged or threatened anyone, Tan said.,
	Japan, on the contrary, has been significantly increasing its defense spending and stepping up the development of military technologies in response to the so-called external threat, Tan said.,
	Tan also rebuked Japan for its enhanced military cooperation with the United States, saying that Japan has become an actual ""challenge"" to regional peace, security and stability.,
	Regarding the Taiwan question, Tan stressed that Taiwan belongs to China and the Taiwan question is a matter that falls under China's internal affairs, in which Japan is in no position to interfere.,
	Noting that the year 2023 will mark the 45th anniversary of the signature of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Tan urged Japan to scrap its beggar-thy-neighbor practices and stop treating neighbors as enemies.,
	Japan should devote more efforts to safeguarding peace and stability in the region, Tan said."
"China's Chengdu strives to build better ""15-minute community life circles""","11:32, January 07, 2023","
	,
	,
	In 15 minutes, people can walk a kilometer, listen to a couple of songs and browse several short videos. However, in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province, more can be done in such a short period.,
	The city has built neighborhoods that enabled its citizens to reach various types of services within a 15-minute walk, such as kindergartens about 100 meters away from residents' homes, parks for a walk after dinner, nearby shopping streets, and cultural exhibitions that are held in almost every block.,
	In October 2021, China's Ministry of Commerce announced the country's first batch of 30 cities where ""15-minute community life circles"" would be piloted, and Chengdu was on the list.,
	The pilot project has brought huge convenience to the people in Chengdu and significantly improved their sense of gain.,
	Xishulu community is one of the 12 communities in Chengdu to pilot the ""15-minute community life circles,"" where the idea of ""a good life is just outside your doors"" is very well explained.,
	A resident surnamed Ma, who has returned to Chengdu after retiring, now lives in Xishulu community. He quite enjoys living in the pilot community.,
	,
	,
	""It's convenient. There are a park, a wet market and a bus station just outside my residential complex. Besides, there's also a community service center where I can get government services, go shopping and take classes. I learn Chinese painting and calligraphy there. The circle enriches my everyday life,"" Ma told People's Daily.,
	In the community service center that Ma mentioned, there are a coffee shop, a university for the aged, a canteen, a retail store selling cultural products, an art gallery and other featured businesses.,
	The center is not only favored by seniors, but also frequented by young people.,
	""I always visit the community service center after work to have some coffee, go window-shopping and do craft making. It's a great relaxation,"" said a 28-year-old citizen surnamed Liang.,
	According to an official with the municipal bureau of housing and urban-rural development in Chengdu, the city has established 227 primary-level cultural facilities to build the ""15-minute community life circles,"" which shall offer not only convenient consumer services, but also accessible cultural experiences for citizens.,
	So far, the city has built 46 primary-level demonstration cultural centers and carried out beautification programs for 91 communities and over 100 book stores, to build a city-wide network that provides citizens with high-quality public cultural services at their doorsteps.,
	,
	,
	Chengdu' Xindu district has developed a mini program that combines online and offline services. On the mini program, citizens can attend classes, watch performances and listen to lectures online.,
	Besides, to tackle the ""last kilometer"" problem of public transport, Chengdu launched a community bus service in 2013. Citizens who take the buses with a transit card are eligible to enjoy the service for free.,
	Different from that of regular bus routes, the average distance between two stations of the community bus service is just around 200 meters, and the stations are close to the gate of community complexes and other populous locations.,
	At present, 519 buses are running along the routes of the service in Chengdu with nearly 140,000 average passenger volume on a daily basis. Most of the passengers are seniors.,
	In addition, Chengdu has built multiple greenways, which makes cycling a new fashion in the city.,
	""The principle of putting people first is a character of public services. Chengdu is going all out to build the '15-minute community life circles' in accordance with the resources and industrial features in different districts and counties,"" said an official with the Chengdu Municipal Development and Reform Commission.,

China’s Type 052D destroyer gets upgraded propulsion system,"10:15, January 12, 2023","
	,
	,
	China's independently developed Type 052D destroyer has reportedly received an upgraded propulsion system, a move analysts said on Wednesday is a normal progression with the technological development and the continued production of ships of this class.,
	The 43rd escort task force of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy set out on Tuesday from a naval port in Zhanjiang, south China's Guangdong Province for the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somali to succeed the mission of the 42nd escort task force, the PLA Navy said in a statement on the day.,
	The flotilla is composed of the Type 052D guided missile destroyer Nanning, the Type 054A guided missile frigate Sanya, and the Type 903 comprehensive supply ship Weishanhu, with two helicopters and dozens of special operation soldiers among a total of more than 700 sailors on board, according to the statement attached with photos.,
	It is the first time the Nanningwill join an escort mission, the PLA Navy said.,
	The Nanning, a destroyer independently developed by China, received an upgraded propulsion system among many other modifications, the PLA Navy statement reads.,
	Since its commissioning, the Nanninghas joined dozens of major exercise missions including far sea training and combat alert patrols, during which it conducted live-fire missile launches several times, the PLA Navy revealed.,
	The Nanningmade its public debut in June 2021in an exercise in the South China Sea, and judging from its appearance, it is an upgraded variation of the Type 052D destroyer with an extended helicopter flight deck to host the newly developed Z-20 utility helicopter and a new anti-stealth radar to counter stealth aircraft, media reported at the time.,
	As the PLA Navy's main type of surface combatant, the Type 052D destroyer has been constructed and commissioned in large numbers, a Chinese military expert who requested anonymity told the Global Times on Wednesday.,
	During the decade-long production of Type 052Ds, it is quite normal that new technologies are implemented in newer ships, the expert said. ""The Type 052D will become more powerful with these new technologies and experiences previous ships have gathered."",
	According to publicly available information and media reports, the first Type 052D, the Kunming, was commissioned in 2014, and 25 have been launched since. Additional hulls were spotted under construction in August 2022.,
	The Type 052D is very reliable and uses mature technologies, making it suitable for mass production, Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, told the Global Times in a previous interview.,
	China also displayed the export version of Type 052DE destroyer at Airshow China 2022 held in Zhuhai, south China's Guangdong Province."
