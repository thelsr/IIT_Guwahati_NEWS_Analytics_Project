Separated conjoined twins living healthy lives,"08:42, February 09, 2023","
	,
	,
	On April 1, 2009, doctors at Hunan Children's Hospital in Central China performed a successful surgery to separate a pair of conjoined twin girls in a procedure that took 3 hours and 13 minutes. Now, over a decade later, the girls have remained healthy and happy, living full lives.,
	The twins – Luo Hong and Luo Lan — were born in Hunan province connected from their breastbones to their abdomens and sharing one liver. This was extremely rare, as only about three in every 100,000 live births result in conjoined twins. They were separated just two weeks after birth.,
	Though the surgery went smoothly, the twins' condition was still complicated. Before being transferred to the general ward, they had been in the neonatal intensive care unit under observation by a medical team led by Gao Xirong, now director of the hospital's neonatology department.,
	More than two months later, the twins were discharged from the hospital. In subsequent years, the hospital continued to care for the twins by giving them free physical examinations every year.,
	""We have also visited their home,"" Gao said. ""Now, both girls are 1.63 meters tall, just like me. And their intellectual and physical development are normal,"" she said with relief.,
	""We are grateful to the hospital and people who have long shown their love for us,"" said Luo Guoquan, the twins' father.,
	Luo Lan, the younger sister, said she wants to be a doctor and help more people."
China plays crucial role in wetland restoration,"10:07, February 09, 2023","
	,
	,
	The shrinking area of wetlands and degrading ecological functions are a challenge faced by the entire world.,
	Since becoming a party of the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance Especially as Waterfowl Habitat, or the Ramsar Convention in 1992, China has constantly enhanced its efforts in legislation, monitoring, science popularization, and international cooperation to fulfill its obligations.,
	China's wetland conservation has gone through three stages: problem identification, rescue protection, and comprehensive conservation.,
	So far, the country has completed over 4,100 projects to advance wetland protection and restoration. It is the only country in the world that has done national wetland resource investigation three times.,
	China boasts remarkable achievements in wetland conservation. Wetland ecology is constantly improving in the country.,
	Its wetland area, covering 56.35 million hectares, ranks the first in Asia and fourth in the world. Especially in the recent decade, China has added or restored more than 800,000 hectares of wetlands. It also has 64 wetlands of international importance and 29 wetlands of national importance. The country is home to 13 international wetland cities, the highest in the world.,
	The total number of wetland-type nature reserves in China has reached more than 2,200, while 11 million hectares of wetlands are included in the country's national park system with stringent protection management.,
	,
	,
	Wetland parks well combine ecological conservation, ecological tourism, and environmental education and thus generate ecological, social, and economic benefits. They are an important part of China's wetland conservation system.,
	Chinese provinces and municipalities are constantly working to apply for national wetland parks and build regional wetland parks, demonstrating China's innovative approach to protecting, restoring, and utilizing wetland.,
	Currently, there are 29 national wetland parks and 26 provincial wetland parks in Sichuan province, and east China's Anhui province has preliminarily established a wetland conservation network that puts 51.8 percent of its wetlands under protection.,
	Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang province, is applying for the wetland city accreditation of the Ramsar Convention, and a provincial-level wetland park is expected to be built near the Qiantang River in the city. It is learned that the coverage of the wetland park will be far beyond that of the Xixi National Wetland Park in the city, which spans 11.5 square kilometers.,
	Over the past few years, China has witnessed a prominent increase in the population of wild birds in wetlands. Rare and endangered bird species have started to show up in wetlands across the country and inhabit in large groups there. This indicates improved wetland ecology in the country.,
	The Yellow River Wetland National Nature Reserve in Zhengzhou, central China's Henan province, sits in the center of the middle channel of China's three major bird migration routes. After years of treatment, the ecology in the nature reserve has constantly improved. There are currently 283 wild bird species in the reserve, up from 169 in 2006.,
	Surveys on wintering birds recently released by local authorities suggested important progress in China's ecological restoration.,
	,
	,
	According to a report by south China's Hainan province, the island province discovered 201 black-faced spoonbills this year, the most since the report started in 2003.,
	Another survey on wintering birds in the Hengshui Lake national nature reserve wetland park in north China's Hebei province said 64,000 birds and 60 species were spotted in the wetland park.,
	While implementing the Ramsar Convention and protecting wetlands, China has explored a path of ecological conservation for man and nature to live in harmony.,
	In October 2022, the National Forestry and Grassland Administration and the Ministry of Natural Resources jointly released a plan for wetland protection for the 2022-2030 period.,
	The plan aims to increase China's wetland protection rate to 55 percent by 2025. According to it, by 2030, a new paradigm of high-quality wetland conservation will be preliminarily established, and the ecological functions and biodiversity in wetlands will be prominently improved.,
	Besides, the plan will also strive to enhance the comprehensive service capability of the wetland ecology system, strengthen wetlands' carbon fixation performance, and build a better legal framework for wetland protection.,
	China will keep promoting green development and work for new progress in global wetland conservation. "
Two Chinese Gen Zers turn to agriculture in E China’s Anhui,"13:28, February 09, 2023","
	Zhu Jiaojie and Li Lingfeng are two Chinese Gen Zers who make their living planting strawberries. Born after the millennium year, they have dedicated their lives to strawberry growing in Guangde city, east China’s Anhui Province.,
	“The most important part is my interest in agriculture. I studied agriculture and forestry in university. Planting strawberries fits my studies, and allows me to apply what I have learned,” says Zhu, who also acknowledges the support given by his family. As for Li, a veteran, his concern and affection for his grandparents prompted him to return home after his retirement. When he came back, he saw opportunities in rural regions and decided to forge a partnership with Zhu.,
	,
	,
	In less than two years, after learning from professionals in Guangde Sanpuhui Agriculture and Technology Development Company Co. Ltd., Zhu and Li gained a working knowledge of strawberry planting. They acquired some advanced skills here because the company is not only the strawberry plantation base of their city, it’s also the strawberry working station of Institute of Horticulture of Zhejiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences.,
	When the temperature drops below zero degrees Celsius, they must close the inner cover of their greenhouse. In the morning, when the temperature rises, they need to take the opportunity to ventilate them. Strawberries love sunlight and cannot survive being soaked, so they must pay special attention to make sure the strawberries have sufficient sunlight and guarantee that the excess water is drained away.,
	,
	,
	The accumulation of experience and knowledge of techniques and management, in addition to their strong work ethic, prompted them to establish their own fields. Today, in addition to owning strawberry fields, they also hold shares in Sanpuhui.,
	They have experimented with two types of planting methods: traditional planting and elevated greenhouse cultivation planting, which yield around 2,500 kilograms and 3,000 kilograms per mu (667 square meters), respectively.,
	,
	,
	In addition to the planting aspect, they have also shown a talent for innovation in sales. They use different channels to sell their produce, including livestream online sales, and self-service in-person sales. Outside their greenhouse, they have put up a stall with strawberries and a QR code for electronic payments, and customers can make purchases by themselves. This method spares them from labor costs, and increases their popularity.,
	“The picking period spans from November to April. Although sales prices have gone down, we yielded more produce this year, and we still expect to earn profits this year,” says Li.,
	The prime time for picking strawberries is around the Chinese New Year, during which Zhu and Li spent most of their time in the fields picking and processing strawberries, even on New Year’s Day and its Eve. “After finishing work in the New Year holiday, we hope to take a break from our work,” they said.,

"Breeders in E China' Anhui release shrimp, crab seedlings into ponds","10:01, February 09, 2023","
	Breeders have been busy releasing shrimp and crab seedlings into their outdoor ponds in Wuhe county, east China's Anhui Province.,
	,
	,
	Located in the plains of northern Anhui, Wuhe county abounds in rivers and lakes, which provide important conditions for local breeders to develop aquaculture and increase their incomes.,
	32-year-old Huang Jingzhong is a local breeder in Wuhe county. In 2018, Huang built a breeding base that uses a rice-shrimp co-culture system.,
	Last year, Huang's cultivation of crab and mandarin fish in his rice fields, which cover an area of 23 mu (about 1.53 hectares), generated more than 200,000 yuan ($29,500) in income for him.,
	,
	,
	""This year, I plan to release 100 kg of shrimp seedlings into the ponds,"" said Huang, adding that he bought the seedlings at 40 yuan per kg and will sell them at 100 yuan per kg during the harvest season.,
	Thanks to the rice-shrimp co-culture system, an increasing number of farmers in Wuhe county have enjoyed bumper harvests of both aquatic products and rice over the past years.,

	,
	BEIJING, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project had transferred over 60 billion cubic meters of water from major rivers in the south to the drought-prone north as of Sunday, official data showed.,
	This amount is greater than the average annual flow of the Yellow River, the country's second longest river, according to the China South-to-North Water Diversion Corporation Limited.,
	More than 150 million people have directly benefited from the massive project.,
	The country's South-to-North Water Diversion Project has three routes. The middle route, the most prominent one, starts at the Danjiangkou Reservoir in central China's Hubei Province and runs across Henan and Hebei before reaching Beijing and Tianjin. It began supplying water in December 2014.,
	The eastern route began operations in November 2013, transferring water from east China's Jiangsu Province to areas including Tianjin and Shandong. The western route is in the planning stage and is yet to be built.,
	China will push forward the follow-up construction of the water diversion project in 2023 and accelerate the building of the national water network, said Jiang Xuguang, chairman of the group."

"China joins multinational naval drills in Pakistan, contributing to safeguarding sea lines, CPEC","10:46, February 12, 2023","
	,
	,
	China, together with host Pakistan and more than 50 participating countries, kicked off the AMAN-23 multinational maritime exercise in Karachi on Friday. The drills are expected to enhance the participants' interoperability against instabilities and threats in the Indian Ocean region and safeguard vital international sea lines of communication and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).,
	A grand opening ceremony for the five-day AMAN-23 exercise was held on Friday morning at the Pakistan Navy Dockyard, in front of the PNS Taimur, a Type 054A/P guided missile frigate that China built for Pakistan. Honor guards raised the participating countries' national flags, while balloons and pigeons representing peace were released into the skies.,
	Under the motto ""Together for Peace"", this is the eighth edition of the AMAN exercises since 2007. It is divided into two phases: harbor and sea.,
	The harbor phase involves seminars, operational discussions, and professional demonstrations among other preparations, and the sea phase includes tactical maneuvers, anti-piracy, counterterrorism, search and rescue, live-fire shooting as well as air defense exercises, and will be followed by an international fleet review.,
	AMAN is a message of peace and of being together with our friends and partners from all over the world, including China, Vice Admiral Ovais Ahmed Bilgrami, Commander of the Pakistan Fleet, told the Global Times on the sidelines at the opening ceremony.,
	""We want to build mutual capacities and mutual understandings so that we can all work together to ensure peace and security at sea,"" he said.,
	""China has been our greatest friend. There's no doubt that whatever the future holds for us at sea, it would not be possible without China. The China and Pakistan friendship is going to prosper further at sea,"" said Commodore Sohail Ahmed Azmie, Commander of the Auxiliary and Mine Squadron of the Pakistan Navy.,
	He told the Global Times at the event that the Pakistan Navy has been operating with the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy, and in the future, this trend is going to be enhanced.,
	The participating vessel from China is the Nanning, a Type 052D guided missile destroyer that is part of the PLA Navy's 43rd escort task force to the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, which set out from a naval port in Zhanjiang, South China's Guangdong Province on January 10.,
	It is the Nanning's first time participating in such a mission. The domestically developed warship has received an upgraded propulsion system among many other modifications, the PLA Navy said in a press release at the time.,
	The Nanning arrived at Karachi on Thursday, and was met with a warm welcome from the host country.,
	Admiral M Amjad Khan Niazi, Chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy, told the Global Times in an exclusive interview prior to the exercise that there are a number of non-traditional threats that prevail in the wider Indian Ocean region such as terrorism, piracy, drug smuggling, and arms trafficking. The vastness of the oceans makes the maritime arena an attractive avenue for illegal activities, and no country has the capability to singlehandedly counter these challenges.,
	The exercise is conducted with the aim of developing synergy between participating naval units to tackle maritime security challenges by enhancing interoperability between regional and extra-regional navies at different levels of technological prowess, he said.,
	As a maritime nation, Pakistan has substantial stakes in keeping its seas safe and secure, including the operationalization of the CPEC project and the global energy highway, the Global Times learned at the exercise.,
	The first edition of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference (PIMEC) was also launched on Friday in Karachi, concurrently with the AMAM-23 exercise.,
	Initiated by the Pakistan Navy, PIMEC aims to showcase the potential of Pakistan's maritime sector and draw attention to the contribution that the maritime industry can make to the development of the blue economy. "
