It differs somewhat from the ', ', with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.\n', 'Military history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future.

Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and ', ' of military conflicts (war), their participating ', ' and ', ' and, more recently, ', '.', 'Despite the growing importance of ', ', military activity depends above all on people.
